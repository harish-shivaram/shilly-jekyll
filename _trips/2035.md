We started early from Rishikesh to beat any traffic, but it             was rather futile. As we get closer to Delhi, the traffic just             seems to explode. Initially, Prashi and I maintained 100kmph.             Poor Sandy seized his engine twice keeping to that speed, so we             dropped our pace to about 80kmph. Damn Madaan's 535's. The way             it was rattling, it sounded more like a dishwasher than a             bullet.

Along the way, people were amazed to see us. Everybody has             seen bullets and riders touring with a huge load of luggage. For             a change, there was somebody touring on a rundown looking             Rajdoot, and keeping up comfortably with Bullets, no less. My             favourite (for obvious reasons) incident of the day was a trio             of guys on a LML Freedom who caught up with Sandy, pointed to my             bike and asked, _&quot;Boss, woh bijli kya thi ?&quot; (&quot;Boss, what was             that bolt of lightning ?&quot;)_

We reached Delhi early in the afternoon, and rode straight             into Naiwallan in Karol Bagh. Sandy was really struggling to             keep the bike going by then. It stalled in the oddest places and             handled very poorly. We reached Madaan's, returned the bike and             checked into the nearest hotel. Sandy was very glad to see the             last of that red beast.

Ranga from Madbulls and Karan &amp; Karthik from Royal Beasts             met us at our hotel. Ranga was riding with us on the second leg,             and was just putting the finishing touches on his bike.             Chaithra's flight from Bangalore was delayed heavily, and when             he finally reached the hotel, it was almost almost 2AM.
