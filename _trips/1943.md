> We got back to the guide's office at about 4:30 PM, and started the safari.  The guide came in my jeep. We saw plenty of bison, spotted deer and sambhar. We also saw 3 wild boars (Yay!!!). Man, those boars move real fast. I got some shots of all of these, but most were real bad. So I got creative with the photos. Here's a female bison, supposedly done in crystals. Shrug.

> More bad bison shots, more creativity. This alpha male's done in water colours. Not half bad, eh ?

> We saw this huge gang of wild dogs at one place. They took off when the jeep came. They had killed a spotted deer and were literally picking the bones clean. I got some snaps of the carcass (or what was left of it).

The main deal with the park is supposed to be its large population of wild elephants. We went looking for them near another watering hole 4km away, but couldn't find any. The guide saw the tracks and said that we had just missed them. Too bad, but that wasn't all. More happened the next afternoon.

It would have been ultimate if we got to see tigers, but there are just 68 of them in 643 acres, as of the census 3 years ago. The likelyhood of seeing one is rather slim. But the guide told us that if we came early in the morning, we might actually catch many animals right on the main road.  Apparently a week ago, tigers were sighted this way.
