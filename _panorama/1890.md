There is a house now far away where once  
I received love... That woman died,  
The house withdrew into silence, snakes moved  
Among books, I was then too young  
To read, and, my blood turned cold like the moon.  
How often I think of going  
There, to peer through blind eyes of windows or  
Just listen to the frozen air,  
Or in wild despair, pick an armful of  
Darkness to bring it here to lie  
Behind my bedroom door like a brooding  
Dog... you cannot believe, darling,  
Can you, that I lived in such a house and  
Was proud, and loved.... I who have lost  
My way and beg now at strangers' doors to  
Receive love, at least in small change?
