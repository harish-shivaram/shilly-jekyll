Sandy and Prashi rode down to the landslide to see what the             scene actually was. We had to be halfway to Joshimath by the             evening, or our plans were all gone to pot. A short while after             they went, a JCB excavator followed them down the road.

When Sandy and Prashi got back, the story they had to tell was             not heartening. About a good 200 metres of road was blocked.             Local folks had cut a small foot path over the slide. The path             was about 2 feet wide, and at places less than 6 inches. One             side was a steep drop into a river, and the mud under their feet             kept slipping as they walked.

We had to make it through, no matter what. We planned to leave             Birthi after lunch and get our bikes through the path. We reach             the slide at about 2 PM, and heavens be praised! The JCB had             cleared off all but the last 10 metres. Since the JCB was still             working in full swing, we simply had to wait until it finished             its job.

By about 4 PM, the road was opened to a couple of government             Gypsies and motorcycles. From there on, we rode hard and steady.             We still had many water crossings and steep ghats to cover that             day. Based on the route, we planned to stay at Baageshwar, which             was about 3 hours ride away.

Sandy's fall a couple of days back had thrown his headlight             out of whack, and it only shone directly above his head. This             slowed us down considerably, since Sandy had to ride depending             on Prashi's and my headlights and fog lamps.

Still, we reached Baageshwar that evening, and checked into             the KMVN guest house there. We now had a comfort factor with             these guest houses. We had stayed in them exclusively, and we             liked the service and the prices.
