It's a tiny story about a cop who works on the moon. But the lunar colony is slowly winding down, like a small town circumvented by a new super highway. As our hero, the Mooncop, makes his daily rounds, his beat grows ever smaller, the population dwindles. A young girl runs away, a dog breaks off his leash, an automaton wanders off from the Museum of the Moon.

He's lonely and melancholy but peaceful and calm. The drawings are so chilly and isolating and the narrative is quaint and touching and funny and quirky. The reader feels the despondency and lack-of-purpose, mixed in with a peacefulness experienced by the protagonist.

A simple and thoughtful read.
