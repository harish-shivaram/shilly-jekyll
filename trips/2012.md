- 15th of August
- _New Delhi - Ghaziabad - Hapur - Moradabad Bypass -               Kashipur - Ramnagar - Haldwani - Kathgodam - Nainital_
- 310km

We left New Delhi early in the morning, at 6AM. The streets of             Delhi were completely vacant. We expected a certain amount of             official presence, what with it being Independence day and             all... but nothing. The few cops who were around, were gracious             enough to direct us out of the melting pot that is New Delhi.

Backward state or not, we saw nice smooth roads throughout UP.             Our journey through the wide 4-lane highway was only marred by             some severe traffic jams.

Rather silly, the jams. Two trucks both try to squeeze through             a gap meant for one, and neither can. Before either one can             reverse out, traffic is backed up as far as the eye can see. One             such jam reputedly took 42 hours to clear. Vestiges of this jam             still remained when we got to the Moradabad bypass. A nudge             here, a squeeze there, a short stretch on a dirt road elsewhere             got us past these jams comfortably.

There was some rain on the way. In fact, we encountered rain             every day of the first leg. The only variation was in the amount             of rain we had to ride through. Believe me, August is not a good             month to spend in Uttaranchal.

The mother of all jams awaited us at Kathgodam, just a short             way from Nainital. A large tree keeled over across the road, and             traffic again was backed up for hours. We squeezed, nudged,             honked and raced our way through the seemingly interminable line             of traffic till the fallen tree. The local police and PWD (_Public Works Department_) were still             working on the larger parts of the tree, but had cut a large             enough path for our bikes to squeeze through. Quite a lucky             break. A lot more nudging, and we reached Nainital late             afternoon.
