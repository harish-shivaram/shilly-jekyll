- 5th of September
- _Hunder (Nubra Valley) - Diskit - Khalsar - Khardung -               North Pullu - Khardung La - South Pullu - Leh_
- 120km


Early next morning, we started back for Leh. I wanted to swing             by Panamik too. There is a fork on the stretch between Diskit             and Khalsar. The left goes towards Panamik, and the right to             Khalsar. Panamik is famous for its sulphur springs, and a dip in             the hot water pools is said to be very therapeutic. Beyond             Panamik is the village of &quot;&quot;, the last Indian village. Any             goats, fields and trees visible beyond &quot;&quot; are property of the             People's Republic of China. But the boys weren't keen on doing             the extra 70km to Panamik and back, so the plan was scrapped. Ah             well, there's always next time.
