As the four of us rode amidst the sands, a Stallion pulled off             the road.

_ The Ashok Leyland Stallion, or ALS for short, is the most             widely used military transport in these parts. It's a work             horse, and a war horse. With a 4-wheel drive and a turbo-diesel             engine, it seems to go anywhere, do anything, scare anyone.             Remember that old Royal Enfield advertisement for the Bullet ?             &quot;Built like a gun, moves like a bullet&quot;. The Stallion is built             like a cannon and moves like a wrecking ball. _

As we ride past, a voice hails us from the Stallion in a             distinctly South Indian language. The driver was a Bangalorean,             and thrilled to bits seeing our license plates. Turns out he was             an ASC (_Army Supplies Corps_) guy             driving a supplies truck loaded with Scotch whisky. He wouldn't             let us go unless we had a few shots with him. I was all for             halting right there in the desert, but Prashi convinced the             driver that we don't drink and ride.

We did get a chance to look around the cabin. The driver had             his own setup in there... a whole tray of boiled eggs and a             bottle of Old Monk Rum.
