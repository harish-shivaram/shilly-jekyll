Like I mentioned earlier, many Ladakhis are adherents of             Tibetian Buddhism. It is a custom among Tibetian Buddhists that             one of the younger children in every family enters a monastery             and is ordained as a Lama. Children are taken to one of the many             Tibetian settlements around India to be initiated into the             monastic way of life.

We met a whole busload of children, accompanied by an elderly             Lama, on their way to a settlement in Orissa. A life full of             meditation, deep learning, chanting and philosophy lay ahead of             them. One could hardly have thought that of the jolly,             rosy-cheeked children who ran around and played in the freezing             cold.

>  When I reached here, I stopped and killed the             engine. In an instant, all audible signs of the dominant species             was lost. The whistling of the wind, the rustling of the grass             and the occasional bleat of a sheep were all I heard. I closed             my eyes, and in my head I could hear the distant strains of a             piano:

>  Like the good book says...
<ol>
    <li>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</li>
    <li>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me               beside the still waters.</li>
    <li>He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of               righteousness for his name' sake.</li>
    <li>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of               death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and               thy staff they comfort me.</li>
    <li>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine               enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</li>
    <li>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of               my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</li>
</ol>
--Psalms 23
