>  The route up to Nainital. 

We checked into the KMVN (Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam) guest             house at Nainital. The whole of Uttaranchal is dotted with these             government owned tourist guest houses. The charges are nominal,             and the locations are phenomenal. You could plan your itinerary             with these. If there's a KMVN at a town, the town's worth             visiting.

We spent the evening boating on the lake in Nainital. The             whole town is on the shores of this lake, called Talli Tal.             Nainital itself is very commercialised and tacky, rather like             Ooty down south.

>  Sandy and Prashi on a boat. What's with the             expressions, guys ? No wonder the boat owner started talking             about honeymooning couples :-)
