Here endeth my &quot;break or gap, esp. in a series&quot;. It's been nigh on two months since I wrote here. Though I do have a whole bunch of excuses, in all honesty, it's just been plain laziness.


I've finally gotten over my addiction to Quake, and substituted it with, oddly enough, an addiction to Scrabble. I've always associated scrabble with public school boys from Calcutta who speak with affected clipped accents and wear thick glasses. But it sure is a fun game to while away time. I suddenly know so much more about words with &quot;Q&quot; in them which do not have a &quot;U&quot; following it. Mind you, all these words are legal Scrabble words.

Next, I'm consulting for two companies now. While it means that there are two gangs who I bleed of moolah, it unfortunately leaves me with absolutely NO free time whatsoever. And I've picked up this bad habit of carrying a laptop with me wherever I go. I feel like those marketing/support folks who treat the laptop like a body attachment. I intend to drop it soon (the habit, not the laptop).


Right, and then throw in motorcycle racing practice, long-distance bicycling practice and Salsa classes (no, really!), and I've covered about all the excuses for not keeping up with the blog. That's also why there haven't been any movie reviews either; there have been NO movies lately. The backlog just keeps piling and piling and piling....
