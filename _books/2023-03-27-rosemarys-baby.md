Rosemary is a modern and fashionable young girl from a small town. She and her
husband, an actor, move in to an old and elegant New York apartment house with
a rather strange past &mdash; there have been several reports of unnatural
deaths of residents in the apartment block.

Rosemary becomes pregnant, but after that, she begins to suspect the building
harbours a diabolically evil group of devil worshippers, who had mastered the
arts of black magic and witchcraft. The satanic cult even seems to have roped
in her husband to their cause by propping up his career, but their sinister
plans seem not to involve him, but her unborn baby.

Both the reader, and Rosemary, get the sense that something is not right, and
that everyone seems to be hiding some sinister purpose, while gaslighting
Rosemary (and indirectly, the reader) into thinking that everything is as it
should be. Or is it....?

The book is easy to read, and there is a slowly building sense of unease, along
with an eerie, unsettling feeling that something sinister is underfoot. The
premise is simple, and it doesn't over complicate itself with too much detail.
The author has an elegant style of writing, with perfect flow and pacing.
Definitely worth reading.
