Look at it this way. 3 of the 8 snaps were kinda dull. Which is a mere 135 degrees of 360. Fairly decent ratio, eh ?

Some more titbits. Locals claim that there exists, or rather existed, a narrow guage railway track which ran parallel to this road. But that track has not been used since the Raj times, and is completely overgrown. So much so that hardly anyone even knows where it is.
