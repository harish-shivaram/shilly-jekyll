Remember me? I am Professor Sheth.  
Once I taught you geography. Now  
I am retired, though my health is good. My wife died some years back.  
By God's grace, all my children  
Are well settled in life.  
One is Sales Manager,  
One is Bank Manager,  
Both have cars.  
Other also doing well, though not so well.  
Every family must have black sheep.  
Sarala and Tarala are married,  
Their husbands are very nice boys.  
You won't believe but I have eleven grandchildren.  
How many issues you have? Three?  
That is good. These are days of family planning.  
I am not against. We have to change with times.  
Whole world is changing. In India also  
We are keeping up. Our progress is progressing.  
Old values are going, new values are coming.  
Everything is happening with leaps and bounds.  
I am going out rarely, now and then  
Only, this is price of old age  
But my health is O.K. Usual aches and pains.  
No diabetes, no blood pressure, no heart attack.  
This is because of sound habits in youth.  
How is your health keeping?  
Nicely? I am happy for that.  
This year I am sixty-nine  
and hope to score a century.  
You were so thin, like stick,  
Now you are man of weight and consequence.  
That is good joke.  
If you are coming again this side by chance,  
Visit please my humble residence also.  
I am living just on opposite house's backside.
