One autumn morn  
I chanced to cross  
A field of corn  
And there it was&mdash;  
That blessed morn&mdash;.  
To sinful me  
The grace was given  
On earth to see  
The ways of Heaven:  
I saw a bird  
And heard a voice  
I ne'er before  
Had seen or heard.  
I did rejoice,  
Yet with my joy  
Was Holy Awe  
At what I saw;  
And what I said  
I know not well,  
For, strange to tell,  
I instantly  
Was on my knee.  

The bird saw too  
Yet did not stir;  
And, 'Who are you  
To ask me, sir?.  
It said, and I  
Did thus reply.  
Grown bolder now,  
I know not how:  
'An untaught poet  
Of trees and birds  
Whom no man knoweth  
And, wanting words,  
But dreams and sings  
Of simple things'&mdash;  
'Peace ! all Heaven knoweth;  
 From Heaven come I:  
Come, simple poet',  
The bird rejoined.  

So, I drew near  
And heard it say&mdash;  
That blessed day&mdash;  
To an ear of corn,  
A tiny ear  
'Grow quick, my dear!  
There's dearth and death  
on every hand,  
In every breath  
Upon this land&mdash;  
Grow quick, my dear!'  

Then was revealed  
At every ear,  
Throughout the field,  
A bird, and clear  
A voice, 'Spare, spare !'  
Was it my prayer  
That blessed morn  
While I did cross  
The field of corn ?  
Perchance it was:  
To sinful me  
Such grace was given&mdash;  
On earth to see  
The ways of Heaven.
