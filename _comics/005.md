Commando was a series of comic books telling stories mostly from World War 2. The stories centre around a team, or a unit, who achieve something against all odds. Chock full of quaint military jargon interspersed with soldier's slang (Jerries = German, for example), the books made for some entertaining reading.

Some stories were based on the front lines, some involved resistance fighters behind the lines, and some stories were based in PoW camps. Stories spanned all fronts, Europe, North Africa, Asia and even the Pacific. I believe most were fictional, but some had a preface specifying real events on which the storuy was based.

Similar to Commandom were the War Picture Library series. While the commando comics were better known, I liked the stories in War picture library better.

Both Commando and War Picture Library books were printed in black and white on cheap paper, about half the size of most regular comics. Conservatively speaking, there were thousands published, and I have probably read only a fraction. But it does tend to get repetitive and predictable, so one tends to lose interest rapidly.
