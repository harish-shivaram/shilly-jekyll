Born in Verona, Paolo Caliari was called Veronese after his native town; but he
moved to Venice in 1553, and his work is closely associated with the Venetian
school. His greatest contribution was the creation of decorative schemes and
paintings which reflected the rich pageantry and splendour of Venetian
ceremony.

Together with Titian and Tintoretto, Veronese is thought to have dominated the
Venetian art scene in the sixteenth century. Although a native of Verona,
Veronese of the most serene republic might have been a more fitting title for
him. His works exhibit all the opulence the Venice had gathered through
centuries of commerce and conquest. He thought nothing of painting religious
scenes in a Venetian setting with the saints in silks and jewels, although some
reproached him for it, others admired this flattering portrayal of their
city-state.

Veronese's gigantic works, some of them as much as thirty feet across, were
carried out in a well-organized workshop with the assistance of his brother and
several of his sons.

He specialized in biblical and historical subjects, and filled them with vast
crowds of people of all sorts: aristocrats and peasants, fashionably dressed
women and freakish buffoons, courtiers, musicians, soldiers and drunks, all
gathered in settings of architectural splendour, rich tableaux in which fact
and fantasy are merged.

This work was produced for the refectory of the convent of San Giorgio
Maggiore, and it depicts Christâ€™s first recorded miracle, when, at the wedding
feast at Cana, he turned water into wine.  The huge stone drinking jars can be
seen in the foreground of the painting.

The only full face portrait is that of Christ himself, seated under the
balustrade with the Virgin next to him; their expressions are tranquil and calm
in the extravagant turmoil around them.  Musicians in the foreground (with two
elegant dogs) add to the mood of boisterous indulgence; one of them &mdash;
dressed in a silver robe &mdash; is thought to be Veronese.

The composition is symmetrically balanced, with depth created by the classical
colonnades at either side and the belltower in the distance. In the clear
shadowless daylight, the teeming activity of the brilliantly choreographed
crowd ( 132 figures in all) fills the vast canvas with life and energy.

The Egyptian princess and her entourage, complete with dwarf jester, have come
straight from a gathering at a Venetian palazzo; with calm assurancee, Veronese
transports the bible story and the viewer to his own special world. As he told
the inquisition tribunal, 'Painters take the same liberties as poets and
jesters.'
