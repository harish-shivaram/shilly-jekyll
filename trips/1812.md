The mega bridge. We came across this huge bridge about 2/3rds of the way. High above a river, this bridge was the better part of 400 metres long. Nestled between two mighty long tunnels, we chose this bridge to take a long-ish break. The view was magnificient all around, and the only sound was that of the stream flowing a good 50 metres below us. The lens-men went hyper, while the others just chose to relax, and drink in the view.

This was the river gushing under the mega bridge.

&ldquo;To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls, Over stones on its way&rdquo;.
  
The river way down below us meanders away between the hills and vales.

This rickety looking foot bridge spanned the river next to the big brother. Sid (motto: I'm the real strong, silent type... Yeah!) and I trekked down a steep path down to the bridge to try and get a couple of snaps from that angle. The things one does to get the right angle.

The bridge ended just as another tunnel started. This is the tunnel ahead.

We found this tiny grass snake near the end of one of the tunnels. I almost plonked my backpack right on it. To get an idea of really how tiny it was, just remember that the rail on which it's lying is about 8cm wide.

A little further on, we found a huge snake skin lying right across the tracks on a bridge. Sid holds up his trophy for display, while Satsang prefers to play Shiva. Shriram (motto: My name is Rafi. Mohammed Rafi.) looks on, while Reena and Usha are positively repulsed. Can't say I blame them, actually. I don't fancy reptiles myself.
