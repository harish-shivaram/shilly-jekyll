excerpt: A new year challenge

New year's resolutions are silly. 

Earth passes an arbitrary point in the cosmos during it's orbit around the sun, and people all over the planet celebrate the event. And make resolutions that they promise to keep until the planet passes through the same arbitrary point again, but usually don't.

This year, I stoop. Walk with the masses. Baa ram ewe.

I resolve to read a book a week, for this year. Take a couple of weeks off, 50 books by the year's end.

Let's go.
