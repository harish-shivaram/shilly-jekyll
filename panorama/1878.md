Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I gaze on so fondly to-day  
Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my arms,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like fairy-gifts fading away,  
Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let thy loveliness fade as it will,  
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would entwine itself verdantly still.  

It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they cheeks unprofaned by a tear,  
That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which time will but make thee more dear;  
No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as truly loves on to the close,  
As the sun-flower turns on her god, when he sets,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same look which she turned when he rose. <br />
