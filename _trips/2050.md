Brief version: We left early morning and had breakfast at             Mulbekh. We rode through the day, passed a convoy, and reached             Leh late afternoon. Awesome roads throughout, we didn't even see             a pothole in these 220km's. Quite a far cry from the day before.

And yeah, the magnetic hill and zero gravity zone are a load             of hogwash. Nothing happened.

>  Taken at Namik La, facing west. Believe me, this             photograph just does not capture the magnitude of the scene. The             highest point to the lowest would have easily been 1500m,             vertically.
