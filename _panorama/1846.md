The glories of our blood and state  
&nbsp; Are shadows, not substantial things;  
There is no armour against Fate;  
&nbsp; Death lays his icy hand on kings:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sceptre and Crown  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must tumble down,  
&nbsp; And in the dust be equal made  
With the poor crook&egrave;d scythe and spade.  

Some men with swords may reap the field,  
&nbsp; And plant fresh laurels where they kill:  
But their strong nerves at last must yield;  
&nbsp; They tame but one another still:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early or late  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They stoop to fate,  
And must give up their murmuring breath  
When they, pale captives, creep to death.  

The garlands wither on your brow,  
&nbsp; Then boast no more your mighty deeds!  
Upon Death's purple altar now  
&nbsp; See where the victor-victim bleeds.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your heads must come  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the cold tomb:  
Only the actions of the just  
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.<br />
