---

My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,  
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:  
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But being too happy in thine happiness,--  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some melodious plot  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singest of summer in full-throated ease.  

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,  
Tasting of Flora and the country green,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!  
O for a beaker full of the warm South,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And purple-stained mouth;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with thee fade away into the forest dim:  

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What thou among the leaves hast never known,  
The weariness, the fever, and the fret  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;  
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And leaden-eyed despairs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.  

Away! away! for I will fly to thee,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,  
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:  
Already with thee! tender is the night,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here there is no light,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.  

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,  
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherewith the seasonable month endows  
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mid-May's eldest child,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.  

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been half in love with easeful Death,  
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take into the air my quiet breath;  
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cease upon the midnight with no pain,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such an ecstasy!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain ---  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To thy high requiem become a sod.  

Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No hungry generations tread thee down;  
The voice I hear this passing night was heard  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient days by emperor and clown:  
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stood in tears amid the alien corn;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same that oft-times hath  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.  

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To toll me back from thee to my sole self!  
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.  
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Past the near meadows, over the still stream,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next valley-glades:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it a vision, or a waking dream?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fled is that music --- Do I wake or sleep?<br />
