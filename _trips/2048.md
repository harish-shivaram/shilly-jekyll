A full day of _hard_ riding, and we reach the village of             Rangdum late in the afternoon. Village may be an exaggeration,             though. It consisted of three houses, a shop, a police outpost             and a Dak bungalow. No electricity, or telephones, or even             running water.

Maggi seemed to be the staple diet of all around here, as we             had more of the vile stuff for dinner. We sat outside till about             six in the evening, enjoying the sunset on the terribly bleak             landscape. Around this time, the whisky in our glasses froze,             and we had to turn in.
