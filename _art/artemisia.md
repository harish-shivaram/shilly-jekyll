Artemisia Gentileschi's early education consisted entirely of painting; in
fact she couldn't read or write until she was an adult. She studied initially
with her painter father and in this way she met Caravaggio, whose chiaroscuro
style impressed her so much that she was drawn to Baroque drama and
expressiveness. She was her own modelk for her firt version of _Susannah and
the Elders_, painted when she was only seventeen.

But at nineteen, Gentileschi was raped by her tutor Agostino Tassi. Her father
sued, and there followed a seven-month trial, during which Gentileschi was
accused of being promiscuous, subjected to intimate examination, and then
tortured with thumbscrews while giving evidence. Tassi was imprisoned for just
one year.

After this humiliation, Gentileschi married another painter, Pierantonio
Stiattesi, and the pair moved to Florence. They both worked at the Academy of
Art and Design, where Gentileschi became the first official woman member,
supported by her patron, Cosimo II de' Medici.

Gentileschi was hailed as a genius and yet frequently decried, because she
possessed a creative talent believed to be exclusively male. Fortunately, this
did not stop her producing works of key importance and even gaining patronage
from Charles I of England. Recent scholarship has declared that Gentileschi
was not merely "a good woman painter", but one of the major visual thinkers of
her era.

_Judith and Holofernes_ illustrates the decapitation of the Assyrian
oppressor Holofernes by the Jewish heroine Judith. This is a powerful
expression of the artist's own emotional turmoil. The realism and dramatic
chiaroscuro easily match Caravaggio or Rubens.

Gentileschi painted five other versions; it was a theme that particularly
appealed to the Florentines who were often threatened by the more powerful
states. For the artist, it was an affirmation of the strength of women in all
kinds of adversity.
