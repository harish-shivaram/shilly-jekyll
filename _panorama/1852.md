title: To India -- My Native Land
poem: true

My country! In thy day of glory past  
A beauteous halo circled round thy brow,  
And worshipped as a deity thou wast.  
Where is that glory, where that reverence now?  
Thy eagle pinion is chained down at last,  
And groveling in the lowly dust art thou:  
Thy minstrel hath no wreath to weave for thee  
Save the sad story of thy misery!  
Well--let me dive into the depths of time,  
And bring from out the ages that have rolled  
A few small fragments of those wrecks sublime,  
Which human eyes may never more behold;  
And let the guerdon of my labour be  
My fallen country! One kind wish from thee!<br />
