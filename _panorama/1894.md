It takes much time to kill a tree,  
Not a simple jab of the knife  
Will do it. It has grown  
Slowly consuming the earth,  
Rising out of it, feeding  
Upon its crust, absorbing  
Years of sunlight, air, water,  
And out of its leperous hide  
Sprouting leaves.  

So hack and chop  
But this alone wont do it.  
Not so much pain will do it.  
The bleeding bark will heal  
And from close to the ground  
Will rise curled green twigs,  
Miniature boughs  
Which if unchecked will expand again  
To former size.  

No,  
The root is to be pulled out &mdash;  
Out of the anchoring earth;  
It is to be roped, tied,  
And pulled out &mdash; snapped out  
Or pulled out entirely.  
Out from the earth-cave,  
And the strength of the tree exposed,  
The source, white and wet,  
The most sensitive, hidden  
For years inside the earth.  
Then the matter  
Of scorching and choking  
In sun and air,  
Browning, hardening,  
Twisting, withering,  

And then it is done.
