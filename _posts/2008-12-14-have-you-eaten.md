In the western world, friends are greeted in a distant, and somewhat cold fashion.

 If you think about it for a second, the usual greeting is &quot;how are you&quot;, &quot;how do you do&quot; or some variation thereof. And irrespective of the truth, the standard answer must be &quot;fine&quot; or some variation thereof. It would be quite unacceptable to answer with a &quot;not good. I've got this crick in my back and a shooting pain along my right thigh blah blah&quot;. I mean, can you get more impersonal ?

 What is worst, it's a terrible conversation opener. &quot;How are you ?&quot; &quot;Fine, and you ?&quot; &quot;Oh, Fine&quot;. Then what next ? What's there to talk about ? It's at this point that people switch to some really inane topic like the weather, or worse. Ugh.

 Which is why I really like the south Indian greeting... &quot;Oota aaithaa ?&quot;, &quot;Chaaputaacha ?&quot;, &quot;Aahaaram kazhichuo ?&quot;. This is much more personal, positive and negative answers are equally acceptable and above all, it's a fantastic opener for further conversation, because all one has to do is build on the response.

 I am planning to use this in all conversations henceforth. So don't be surprised if I run into you sometime in life and say:

 <blockquote>&quot;Hi... have you eaten?&quot;</blockquote> &nbsp;
