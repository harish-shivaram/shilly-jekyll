On the way down from Kala-Muni, we stopped at a village and it             was there that we first heard the news. The torrential rains the             previous day had caused a series of landslides, and the entire             region was cut off till it was cleared. We were a little             sceptical... but already started worrying about what this would             do to our schedules. We did see some interesting local folk at             the bad news village though.

Shortly before Birthi, the road was covered with moss             underneath a particularly vicious water crossing. I crossed             first, and after getting about halfway across, the front wheel             slipped. I put my foot down to stabilise, and my foot slipped,             landing me butt first into the water. Prashi comes running to             help me, and he slipped and fell too.

We try to stand the bike up, and it slides another foot closer             to the steep precipice. I lay there wondering how to go about             getting the bike up. Tie a rope and haul it... get a Sumo and             drag it... Prashi had a simpler solution. One leg on the centre             stand on one side, and haul it up. It worked beautifully, and we             were safely back in the KMVN in 10 minutes to deliver the bad             news to Sandy.

We had two days to reach Joshimath. If that doesn't happen,             then the Valley of Flowers was bust. Things weren't looking up,             as it started raining shortly. That would definitely have slowed             any repair work that might have been started.

I rode down to Kwiti with the KMVN caretaker to check on the             situation, but phone lines were down as well. By the time we             reached the guest house, the heavens had completely let go. It             seemed like the previous night was just a teaser, and this time             it was the real thing. We went to bed that evening on a very             sombre note.
