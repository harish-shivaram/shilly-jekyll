From Bhowali, we took the road up to Mukteshwar. We passed a             lot of picturesque valleys and stepped farms on the way. The             weather changed very frequently, with rains coming on in brief             spells of 10 minutes or so. The lighting was generally poor, so             the photography was limited.

We reached the KMVN Tourist Rest house late in the afternoon.             We seemed to be the only guests there, what with it being             off-season and a non-weekend. A short trek away from the guest             house is a place called Chauli Ki Jaali. It is supposed to be             the suicide point to scare the bravest. But we were spared the             nightmares by a thick cloud cover which blanketed the whole             valley.

The guest house caretaker looked like he lasted 6 rounds with             Dara Singh back in the day, but was very nifty with the ladle             and saucepan. He rustled up a pretty mean dinner... comprising             Aloo Parathas and chicken soup.

Booze in Uttaranchal is 4 times (yes, that's _FOUR_) as             expensive as in Karnataka. Despite that, all brands, including             the premium ones, are available easily. The booze shops here are             like bank cashier strongboxes, with a thick iron mesh. A small             opening in the mesh is used to transact bottles and currency.
