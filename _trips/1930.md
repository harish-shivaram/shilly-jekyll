Morning, time for a bit of off-roading. Call us brave, but those were the days before Hit-Air jackets and padded leather riding pants. We would probably have laughed if someone mentioned Joe Rocket. Denim jackets provided us with all the protection we needed. In retrospect, maybe we were right then; is all our fancy protective gear overkill ?

 Anyway, I digress. We found a suitable rock formation and ran our bikes up and down it.

 > Easha was next. Yeah, that is Ega Swagy, hard though it may seem to believe. Ega gave up halfway up the slope, and Kartz rode Ega's thumper to the summit. He lost his balance and came tumbling down, bullet and all. He didn't injure himself or the bike too seriously, so no harm, no foul.
