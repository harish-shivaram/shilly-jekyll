AN OLD STORY  

I  

It was roses, roses, all the way,  
With myrtle mixed in my path like mad.  
The house-roofs seemed to heave and sway,  
The church-spires flamed, such flags they had,  
A year ago on this very day!  

II  

The air broke into a mist with bells,  
The old walls rocked with the crowds and cries.  
Had I said, &quot;Good folks, mere noise repels -  
But give me your sun from yonder skies!&quot;  
They had answered, &quot;And afterward, what else?&quot;  

III  

Alack, it was I who leaped at the sun,  
To give it my loving friends to keep.  
Nought man could do have I left undone,  
And you see my harvest, what I reap  
This very day, now a year is run.  

IV  

There's nobody on the house-tops now -  
Just a palsied few at the windows set -  
For the best of the sight is, all allow,  
At the Shambles' Gate - or, better yet,  
By the very scaffold's foot, I trow.  

V  

I go in the rain, and, more than needs,  
A rope cuts both my wrists behind,  
And I think, by the feel, my forehead bleeds,  
For they fling, whoever has a mind,  
Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.  

VI  

Thus I entered Brescia, and thus I go!  
In such triumphs, people have dropped down dead.  
&quot;Thou, paid by the World, - what dost thou owe  
Me?&quot; God might have questioned; but now instead  
'Tis God shall requite! I am safer so.<br />
