Lena Duchannes is unlike anyone the small Southern town of Gatlin has ever seen, and she's struggling to conceal her power, and a curse that has haunted her family for generations. But even within the overgrown gardens, murky swamps and crumbling graveyards of the forgotten South, a secret cannot stay hidden forever.

Ethan Wate, who has been counting the months until he can escape from Gatlin, is haunted by dreams of a beautiful girl he has never met. When Lena moves into the town's oldest and most infamous plantation, Ethan is inexplicably drawn to her and determined to uncover the connection between them.

In a town with no surprises, one secret could change everything.

Yeah. I very nearly DNF'ed this book several times. But I persevered, and quite frankly, I wish I hadn't bothered. Why do Americans think that this civil war of theirs is so significant and important? One would have thought they would be embarrased by the war, and even more so because of the reason for which it was fought.

Anyway, I really don't want to spend any more time talking about this. Please stay away...
