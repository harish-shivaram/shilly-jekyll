The Last Man is a comic book series by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra
published by Vertigo beginning in 2002. Winner of three Eisner Awards and one
of the most critically acclaimed, best-selling comic books series of the last
decade, this comic series is that rare example of a page-turner that is at once
humorous, socially relevant and endlessly surprising.

Yorick is an amateur escape artist, and the titular "last man". Ampersand is
his pet monkey. The two of them are the only survivors of a plague that killed
every mammal with a Y chromosome. Being the last man on earth isn't as fun as
it sounds, and Yorick now has to embark on a journey to Australia, to reunite
with his girlfriend, and the only woman he wants to be with, in a world with
only women.

This is an endlessly addictive, fully entertaining 60 issue series. Intruiging
concept, compelling characters, memorable moments, and simple, unadorned
artwork. This series is an absolute must read.
