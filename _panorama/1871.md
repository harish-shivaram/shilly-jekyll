Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)  
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,  
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,  
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,  
An Angel writing in a book of gold:  

Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,  
And to the Presence in the room he said,  
&quot;What writest thou?&quot; The Vision raised its head,  
And with a look made of all sweet accord  
Answered, &quot;The names of those who love the Lord.&quot;  

&quot;And is mine one?&quot; said Abou. &quot;Nay, not so,&quot;  
Replied the Angel. Abou spoke more low,  
But cheerily still; and said, &quot;I pray thee, then,  
Write me as one who loves his fellow men.&quot;  

The Angel wrote, and vanished. The next night  
It came again with a great wakening light,  
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,  
And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest!
