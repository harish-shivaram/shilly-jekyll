From Bhim Tal, on towards Naukuchia Tal. The lake's name             literally means that it's nine-cornered.

>  Naukuchia Tal - The nine cornered lake. See if             you can count them. 

There is a diversion off the road from Bhim Tal to Naukuchia             Tal, to the local para-gliding school. They were off-season too,             but we got an idea of the kind of scenery we would be gliding             into.

We stopped at Naukuchia Tal for lunch. A word about lunch. The             staple diet all over Uttaranchal is Parathas. They are consumed             as breakfast, lunch, dinner, in-between meals and midnight             snacks. They can either be eaten plain, or with more Parathas.             If you are allergic to Parathas, avoid Uttaranchal.

From Naukuchia Tal, the plan was to head back to Bhowali, and             on towards Mukteshwar. We reached Bhowali, and just as we pulled             into the pump, Prashanth ran completely dry. Quite an             interesting occurrence it would have been, except that the pump             was still dry. So we were stranded, and trying to figure out how             to proceed, when we heard that Nainital now had fuel.

Since I still was running comfortably, as was Sandy, we both             headed back to Nainital and get fuel in my 20 litre extra can. I             also used to opportunity to fill up my own tank. It was             interesting to ride down the ghats with an extra 20 litres of             fuel on my bike. In case the irony of that slipped past anybody,             let me repeat that.

_An RD350 fetched fuel for a stranded             Bullet._

Meanwhile, as Prashi waited at the petrol pump, a bullet with             a Royal Beasts sticker passed by, which Prashi waved down.             Prashi wanted to locate Karthik of Royal Beasts, and thought the             lone rider would shed some light on his whereabouts. As Prashi             approached him, the Beaster took off in fright. More on the             Beaster later.
