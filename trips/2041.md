After I took this snap, one of my gloves was missing. It had             fallen over the edge into the valley, about 10m below. In fact,             you can actually see it about to fall over, a couple of feet in             front of the front wheel. I climbed down to retrieve it. That             short trek left me completely exhausted. My metabolism had yet             to adjust to the thin air.

Chaithra had a minor scrape late in the afternoon. Oncoming             convoy and a pedestrian left him with no choice but to brake on             gravel, allowing him to perform a nice little Bhoomi Namaskaram (_Prostration on the ground_).             He was unscathed, but that was more than could be said of the             bike. The headlight &amp; dome were smashed in, and the tank was             cracked and leaking.

We reached Kargil late in the afternoon, and quickly checked             into a hotel. Quickly unloading luggage, we set out to locate a             mechanic to fix Chaithra's headlight. The existing dome was             could not be repaired, but a locally procured fake Yamaha dome             was substituted. I do believe it was much brighter than the             stock Royal Enfield Thunderbird halogen headlight it replaced.             Some M-Seal on his tank took care of the crack too.

We checked up on the route for the next day. All locals were             unanimous on one thing, that Zanskar was unapproachable, and the             road... well... wasn't a road at all. Aah... we hadn't come this             far to be scared by such reports. We filled our tanks and my             spare can, as we planned to be off early the next day. We             expected that night to be really cold, but it really wasn't too             bad at all.
