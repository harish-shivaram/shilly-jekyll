Ms. Shilly Ash hates horror movies!

All of them, from the classics (nightmare on elm street) through the campy (wrong turn) right up to the new-age slasher (saw).

How does one quantize the entertainment value of gobs of red stuff, screams, and monsters with face-masks? How can I put a price on the exhilarating thrill combined with feelings of revulsion that arise in the viewer? And how, oh dear God, how do I imbibe in somebody a love of the bizzare, occult and gruesome ?

OK, so we don't watch as many movies any more, and have a huge backlog of titles in the TBD list, but I do wish we didn't have an entire genre taboo!
