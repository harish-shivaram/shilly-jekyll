- 16th of August
- _Nainital - Bhowali - Bhim Tal - Naukuchia Tal - Bhowali -               Nainital - Bhowali - Mukteshwar_
- 100km

The traffic on the way up to Nainital was still held up by the             aberrant tree, as none of the petrol pumps in Nainital had             replenished their stocks. I'd tanked up the day before, and             Sandy had an extra large tank, but Prashi was running             dangerously low. We decided to head on towards Bhowali, hoping             that the pumps there were stocked.

>  The town of Bhowali. 

We started down towards the town of Bhowali, about 23km from             Nainital. Bhowali is centrally located among the nine lakes that             make up Nainital (literally, nine lakes). The pumps at Bhowali             were all sold out too, so we headed on towards Bhim Tal. A very             pretty lake it was too, with mountains in the backdrop. It was             nice to see that all the lakes were clean and sparkling, unlike             Ulsoor lake back home.
