Give to me the life I love,  
&nbsp; Let the lave go by me,  
Give the jolly heaven above  
&nbsp; And the byway nigh me.  
Bed in the bush with stars to see,  
&nbsp; Bread I dip in the river -  
There's the life for a man like me,  
&nbsp; There's the life for ever.  

Let the blow fall soon or late,  
&nbsp; Let what will be o'er me;  
Give the face of earth around  
&nbsp; And the road before me.  
Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,  
&nbsp; Nor a friend to know me;  
All I seek, the heaven above  
&nbsp; And the road below me.  

Or let autumn fall on me  
&nbsp; Where afield I linger,  
Silencing the bird on tree,  
&nbsp; Biting the blue finger.  
White as meal the frosty field -  
&nbsp; Warm the fireside haven -  
Not to autumn will I yield,  
&nbsp; Not to winter even!  

Let the blow fall soon or late,  
&nbsp; Let what will be o'er me;  
Give the face of earth around,  
&nbsp; And the road before me.  
Wealth I ask not, hope nor love,  
&nbsp; Nor a friend to know me;  
All I ask, the heaven above  
&nbsp; And the road below me.
