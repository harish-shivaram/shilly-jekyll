No sign of Ligeo.

 After an hour filled with much misinformation and confusion regarding Ligeo's whereabouts, we rode back. Poor Ligeo's chain had snapped!  No sweat. The true biker is definitely NOT a boy scout, but he IS always prepared. Joy plugged in a spare link, and we were off.

 The last 45 kms to Munnar were something else. Rain, fog, steep ghat roads, and it's pitch black. Often it was an effort to locate the tail light of the bike up ahead. I can be more descriptive, but I fear I shall run out of adjectives, right on the first day. Truly, the entire trip was full of such unimaginable experiences. We reached Munnar town proper by 7:30 PM.

> The road on to munnar 

 What a ride the first day was! We finished off the day with copious amounts of alcohol and Kerala style beef fry. We were in a single 7-bed room  at a 100 bucks a guy a night. Not at all a bad deal. Except that some of the bikers snore... I do not want to mention Vipin and Joy by name, and I do not want to point my finger at Jahangir... but these guys are so loud that they would put pneumatic drills to shame. Not that it bothered anybody, though.  The big bang would have had trouble rousing us that day.
