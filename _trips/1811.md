Ever wonder why they call it the green route ? Greens as far as the eye can see, and there it blends with the blue. Just staring at it is therapeutic.

Cogito Cogito Ergo Cogito Sum. I think that I think, therefore I think that I am. Ujjal in a pensive mood.

Just made it across another bridge. There were over 20 of these... atleast I think so. I lost count. In fact, after the first few, no one even really noticed them. We just crossed and kept going.

This one I took halfway through a bridge. A slight perspective on what the bridges were like. Those sleepers were over a foot apart, and those flat iron plates in the middle weren't always there. Often it was easier to walk on the outside of the track, rather than in between.

We encountered many stretches like this one, where the track was either partially or completely overgrown with vegetation. A touching spectacle of nature reclaiming its property after the ravages of man.

So it wasn't just our eyes. Every time as we came out of a tunnel, the world looked a lot greener than we remembered it. An interesting illusion, which my camera has faithfully captured. We had quite a few of these tunnels too... 23 to be precise. The tunnels, unlike the bridges, were numbered. Many were quite short at under 200 metres.  

 There were a couple of tunnels which went on for over half a kilometre, and were teeming with thousands of bats. It's only possible to catch glimpses of them, but you can hear them flapping their leathery wings all around you. Very eerie.  

 I did try to take a photograph of the bats, but that was an impossible shot, if ever. They move too fast, and stay in dark places. In retrospect, this is how I should have done it. Powerful flash, very high shutter speed, and no other light sources. I would have had to set it up before I entered the tunnel. Faugh! Next time, maybe.
