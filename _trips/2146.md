> Somewhere o'er these hills, not too far away is Munnar, where we were earlier today. This shot taken from Suicide point, facing west.

> The Boys at Suicide Point. L-R: Harish, Vipin, Jahangir, Easha.

> We did see the other end of the road from Munnar, with a forest checkpost. And of course, a large board stating that we will be prosecuted to kingdom come if we attempt it.

 ![Sign Post](/images/trips/munnar/27050009.jpg 'Sign Post'){:.image .fit}

> This is an interesting signpost, at the entrance to the &quot;Coschen Road&quot;. This is basically the same route we attempted the previous day. So it does look like the route was open to traffic not too long ago. L-R: Jahangir, Harish, Vipin and Arun.

  We spent the better part of the evening trying to get the fireplace to go, but eventually gave up to watch the Canadian Grand Prix qualifiers.  Copious amounts of alcohol! Ralf on pole! Kimi spun out! Bison in the backyard!
