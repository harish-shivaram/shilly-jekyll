Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price—and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker. Kaz is offered a chance at a deadly heist that could make him rich beyond his wildest dreams. But he can’t pull it off alone. . . .

- A convict with a thirst for revenge
- A sharpshooter who can’t walk away from a wager
- A runaway with a privileged past
- A spy known as the Wraith
- A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums
- A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes

Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist. Kaz’s crew is the only thing that might stand between the world and destruction—if they don’t kill each other first.

This is the first book of another YA fantasy-romance series set in the same world as Shadow and bone, with even more complex characters in all shades of gray. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, and a complex, and often tragic back story. All of this is explored and provides a great in-depth look into their psychae and motivations for their actions.

The pacing is flawless and the world building is even more elaborate and spectacular. Excellent read.
