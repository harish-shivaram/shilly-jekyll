>  The route to the Valley is between those             mountains. The profile of those mountains look familiar ? Yes...             the Valley of Flowers is in South India. 

We started trekking towards the Valley of Flowers early in the             morning. We literally were the first to enter the park reserve             that morning. Anyway, inside the park, we took quite a few             photographs, and there's not much of a story to tell. The             photographs talk for themselves.
