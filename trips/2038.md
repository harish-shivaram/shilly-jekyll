- 29th of August
- _Madhopur - Samba - Udhampur - Batote - Jawahar Tunnel -               Srinagar_
- 348km


Another long day of hard riding. Our original plan was to ride             to Jammu, 100km from Madhopur. From Jammu, it was another 300km             to Srinagar. Hours were spent discussing how we should do it,             and whether we could do it at all... we just concluded simply:             _&quot;Let's go as the road takes us.&quot;_

A few km beyond Madhopur is the Punjab - JK border. The nice             wide 6-lane continues, and we kept good speeds till a police             check-post at Samba, from where the mountain roads start. The             cops there pointed out a much shorter route to Srinagar,             bypassing Jammu entirely, and shaving 50km off the route.

We stopped to re-fuel in Udhampur. From Udhampur onwards,             EVERY 100m, is a soldier with an automatic rifle. Not lounging             around with the the gun slung over his shoulder. They're             literally on full alert, guns in hands, eyes following you till             the next soldier starts his glare. I'm talking a good 250km             here, from Udhampur to Srinagar. We could measure our distance             by counting the soldiers. Every 100m.

We frequently passed moving patrols too. These are Gypsies or             Stallions with a mounted machine gun. Every convoy is flanked by             a few of these patrol vehicles. We weren't allowed to stop             anywhere, or take photographs. Pull out a camera, and within a             few seconds, we have three guns trained on us. From what we             could see, the highest population here are not Kashmiri pundits,             or Kashmiri muslims. It's soldiers, they are the majority             population. It's a complete war zone there.

We kept weaving around convoys and soldiers, till we reached             Srinagar in the afternoon. Though the road was very good, the             constant military presence dampened our riding vigour. It was so             surreal, we no longer felt like we're in our motherland. All our             lives, we always knew soldiers exist. We all had a cousin in the             navy, or an uncle in the army. But it was always distant,             somewhere else. Here it's right in our faces, not numbers in a             magazine article.

Srinagar! We rode straight to Dal lake and checked into a             houseboat. The boat was phenomenal. It's like a exquisite 5-star             suite. Living room, dining room, kitchen, huge bedroom, running             hot &amp; cold water, all at the price of Rs. 700 a night for             the three of us. That's how hard people have been hit by the             lack of tourism. I couldn't have imagined paying less that Rs.             10,000 a night elsewhere for that kind of luxury.

>  Late afternoon, on Dal lake. 

That evening, we did the usual Shikara tour around the lake,             and visited an wood fretwork shop in a back-alley waterway. The             old gentleman, who looked like he'd been carving wood since the             dawn of time, gave us the grand tour. We bought quite a few of             his creations. That night, we had a nice long sleep after a             heavy dinner.
