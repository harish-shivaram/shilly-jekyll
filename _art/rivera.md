Diego Rivera was a Mexican painter whose bold large-scale murals stimulated a
revival of fresco painting in Latin America. Between 1922 qnd 1953, Rivera
painted murals in, amopng other places, Mexico City, Chapingo, Cuernavaca, San
Francisco, Detroit and New York City.

A government scholarship enabled Rivera to study art at the Academy of San
Carlos in Mexico City from age 10, and a grant from the governor of Veracruz
enabled him to continue his studies in Europe in 1907. He studied in Spain and
in 1909 settled in Paris, where he became a friend of Pablo Picasso, Georges
Braque, and other leading modern painters. About 1917 he abandoned the Cubist
style in his own work and moved closer to the Post-Impressionism of Paul
Cézanne, adopting a visual language of simplified forms and bold areas of
colour.

On returning to Mexico, Rivera painted his first important mural, _Creation_,
for the Bolívar Auditorium of the National Preparatory School in Mexico City.
In 1923 he began painting the walls of the Ministry of Public Education
building in Mexico City, working in fresco and completing the commission in
1930 . These huge frescoes, depicting Mexican agriculture, industry, and
culture, reflect a genuinely native subject matter and mark the emergence
of Rivera’s mature style. Rivera defines his solid, somewhat stylized human
figures by precise outlines rather than by internal modeling. The flattened,
simplified figures are set in crowded, shallow spaces and are enlivened with
bright, bold colours.  The Indians, peasants, conquistadores, and factory
workers depicted combine monumentality of form with a mood that is lyrical and
at times elegiac.

_Man at the Crossroads_ was originally slated to be installed in the lobby of
the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center in New York City, the fresco showed
aspects of contemporary social and scientific culture. As originally installed,
it was a three-paneled artwork. A central panel, depicting a worker controlling
machinery, flanked by two other panels, The Frontier of Ethical Evolution and
The Frontier of Material Development, which respectively represented socialism
and capitalism. 

When it was discovered that Rivera had included a portrait of Lenin and a
Soviet May Day parade in the fresco, the Rockefeller family ordered the fresco
to be plastered over, thereby destroyed before it was finished.

Only black-and-white photographs exist of the original incomplete fresco, taken
when Rivera suspected it might be destroyed. Using the photographs, Rivera
repainted the composition in Mexico under the variant title _Man, Controller of
the Universe_.
