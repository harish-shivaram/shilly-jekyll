Matisse had an orderly and brilliant academic mind; he would probably have been
a lawyer if he had not turned to painting to amuse himself during a period of
convalescence from appendicitis. As a result, the world of art gained one of
its most outstanding and admired figures of the twentieth century.

What began as a diversion for Matisse became an obsession, and he gave up his
legal training and joined the studio of Gustave Moreau in Paris. He was
influenced by the Impressionists, and particularly by the work of Cezanne. But
he broke away from their gentle studies in light, and by 1905 had become the
leader of a group of artists known as Les Fauves, the wild beasts, because of
their use of violent explosive colour and aggressively rough paint textures. He
was also much drawn to the formality, the inventive patterns and the colours of
Islamic art, particularly after a visit to the great Islamic exposition in
Munich in 1910.  This influence can be seen in the pure, contrasting colours
and shapes of most of his work. He turned his talent to sculpture and
printmaking, books, murals and designs for the theatre as well as painting.

His subjects were mainly domestic interiors, scenes framed by windows, and &mdash; 
above all &mdash; the female form. He said, ‘What interests me most is neither still
life nor landscape, but the human figure. It is through it that I best succeed
in expressing the almost religious feeling I have towards life.’

_Dance_ and _Music_ were two decorative panels produced for the Russian collector
Sergei Shchukin, which explains why they are now, after confiscation from
private ownership, in the Russian state collections. But Matisse had initially
produced for Shchukin’s inspection another full-scale version of _Dance_ &mdash; over
eight-and-a-half feet high and nearly thirteen feet wide &mdash; and this is the one
that is now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In it Matisse probably
used as his starting point a ring of dancers from the background of his own
painting _Bonheur de vivre_. 1909 was the year Diaghilev and the Russian ballet
arrived in Paris, and dance was a topical subject.  The figures are dancing on
a hill (a traditional site for ancient mystic rites and ceremonies), but it is
as if they are afloat in the blazing blue sky, their feet barely touching the
ground.

Their five naked bodies, linked in a circle, are painted in clear flat colour
without shadows, and the simplified outlines of the figures stand out very
strongly against the background. They are drawn without detail, but the
movement of their limbs and twisting bodies is realistic and full of life. The
vibrant blue and green of the sky and the grass are perfectly balanced and
extraordinarily intense. The total effect of this striking painting is one of
primitive joy and exhilaration, communicating the joy Matisse derived from
brilliant colour and dramatic forms.
