description: An autobiographical account of Craig's coming to terms with his faith and reconciling it with his sexuality
---

This is a beautifully illustrated graphic novel with an insightful story. It is often cited as an example of how graphic novels are a more poignant form of literature than books of prose.

The protagonist, author Craig Thompson, is raised in a very conservative born-again christian family in Wisconsin. As someone who loves Jesus and reads his Bible daily, Craig has developed a fear of sexuality, finely tuned by his parents, his teachers, and his church. For many, many years he is the perfect Christian boy - one who never ever masturbates because it's a sin and feels extreme guilt and shame for drawing one single picture of a naked woman. He really and truly feels like he is "making Jesus sad" when he thinks lustful thoughts.

Then he meets a girl at Christian Camp. Her name is Raina, she is beautiful and obviously really likes Craig.

Can Craig kiss Raina? Can he sleep in the same bed next to her? Can he bring himself to make love to her? Or has his religion screwed his sexuality up so badly that he's beyond repair?

This book is magnificent. The illustrations are sparse but suit the mood of the book, while bringing out the deepest emotions of the characters. Only a truly great artist would be able to emote as much with a simple brush stroke.

Throughout the book, Craig is at the middle of a war brewing within him, between his church sponsored indoctrination and his heart's wishes. Several casualities in this war; Craig goes through frantic periods where he literally burns everything he owns that he thinks is 'sinful' or a 'temptation', which includes stuff that is very personal and valuable.

The ending, while sad, is all too realistic. The book handled a lot of things tastefully, when it would have been very easy to make the book hateful or angry or vengeful.

Strongly recommend.
