Watteau was born in Valenciennes, a town near the Flemish border which had
recently become French. From a very early age he was passionate in his love of
drawing and studied art in his native town. In about 1702 he moved to Paris,
where he earned a meagre living as a hack painter, and a few years later went
to work for Claude Audran, the curator of the Luxembourg Palace; through him
and subsequent connoisseurs and collectors he had access to some of the work of
Rubens, for whom he developed an enormous admiration, although his own style
was always more introverted and poignant than that of the energetic Rubens.

Watteau’s paintings have all the delicacy and prettiness of the Rococo movement
of the early eighteenth century, which followed the age of Baroque.  It began
in France after the death of Louis XIV in 1715, and spread to Southern Germany
and Austria in the next forty years.

He disliked working for patrons on commission, and most of his pictures seem to
have been created at his own whim, and paid for by clients in advance or bought
by art dealers. Even the subject of this painting, _The Embarkation for Cythera_,
which he was asked to create for his formal admission to the French Royal
Academy, was left to his discretion, instead of being stipulated as was
generally the case. As a result, Watteau was able to add a new classification
to French art : the fete galante , pictures which, like Giorgione’s, take a
mood as their subject.  It was a romantic mood in which the pleasures of the
senses and the fulfilment of the emotions were pursued with a gentle ardour in
idealized country settings.

It is thought that The Embarkation for Cythera was inspired by a play in which
two lovers make a pilgrimage to the island of Cythera off the coast of Southern
Greece, the island which Venus may have reached at the moment of her birth from
the sea. In Watteau’s painting the statue of Venus is garlanded with flowers,
and the shell motif on the golden barge is another reminder of her birth.
Little winged putti , symbols of love, drift over the sea. Peasants, villagers
and courtiers are wending their way down to the water’s edge to board the
barge, and others on the bank are rising to join them. In the centre a woman
looks back with a tender smile, and her elegant, amorous cavalier, his arm
about her waist, gently urges her to join the procession.

The hazy landscape is idyllic in the evening sun, and filled with an atmosphere
of love and flirtation. We cannot be sure if the couples are embarking on the
journey to Cythera, or if the mood is one of sweet regret that the day on the
island of love is over and they must return; but this exquisite painting has an
atmosphere of wistful melancholy, implying the transitory nature of happiness
and life itself. It reflects the restlessness of Watteau’s temperament and his
striving after perfection; and it is one of the most haunting and delicate
examples of French eighteenth-century art.

Watteau may have painted this as a sign for a cafe owned by Belloni, an actor
who played the role of melancholic Pierrot from the commedia dell'arte.
Contrasting the gravity of Gilles with the boisterous group behind him, Watteau
sets him apart in a colourless world of his own. By this time, Watteau was
quite ill with tuberculosis and possibly very sensitive to the certainty that
all the world's pleasures are transient.
