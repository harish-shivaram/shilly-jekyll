- 31st of August
- _Kargil - Sankhoo - Rangdum_
- 120km


There's very little to say. Sankhoo is about 30+km from             Kargil. Beyond Sankhoo, all signs of civilisation end. No             people, no houses, fields, animals, nothing. Oh, and no road             either. Let the pictures tell their story.
