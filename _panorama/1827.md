I leant upon a coppice gate  
&nbsp; When Frost was specter-gray,  
And Winter's dregs made desolate  
&nbsp; The weakening eye of day.  
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky  
&nbsp; Like strings of broken lyres,  
And all mankind that haunted nigh  
&nbsp; Had sought their household fires.  

The land's sharp features seemed to be  
&nbsp; The Century's corpse outleant,  
His crypt the cloudy canopy,  
&nbsp; The wind his death-lament.  
The ancient pulse of germ and birth  
&nbsp; Was shrunken hard and dry,  
And every spirit upon earth  
&nbsp; Seemed fervourless as I.  

At once a voice arose among  
&nbsp; The bleak twigs overhead  
In a full-hearted evensong  
&nbsp; Of joy illimited;  
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,  
&nbsp; In blast-beruffled plume,  
Had chosen thus to fling his soul  
&nbsp; Upon the growing gloom.  

So little cause for carollings  
&nbsp; Of such ecstatic sound  
Was written on terrestrial things  
&nbsp; Afar or nigh around,  
That I could think there troubled through  
&nbsp; His happy good-night air  
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew  
&nbsp; And I was unaware.
