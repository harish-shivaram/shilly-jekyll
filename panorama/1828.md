Does the road wind up-hill all the way?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, to the very end.  
Will the day's journey take the whole long day?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From morn to night, my friend.  

But is there for the night a resting-place?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.  
May not the darkness hide it from my face?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot miss that inn.  

Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have gone before.  
Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?  
&nbsp;&nbsp; They will not keep you standing at that door.  

Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of labour you shall find the sum.  
Will there be beds for me and all who seek?  
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, beds for all who come.
