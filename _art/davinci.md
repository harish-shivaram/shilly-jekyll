Leonardo, born in the small village of Vinci in Tuscany, was the illegitimate
son of a Florentine notary. He studied under Verrochio, who is said to have
given up painting almost entirely as a result of his pupil’s outstanding
ability.

He was the greatest universal genius of the Italian Renaissance, when
intellectual and artistic supremacy were admired above all, and the ideal man
was accomplished in almost every sphere. Apart from his skill as a painter and
sculptor, he was a brilliant scientist, musician, poet, military engineer and
inventor, with one of the most versatile minds in history. He came near to
discovering the circulation of the blood, made preliminary designs for several
aircraft, a submarine and the first armoured vehicle; he made intense studies
of anatomy, the formation of rocks and the fall of drapery, and produced
endless notes and drawings that reveal his curiosity and inventiveness. His
working methods were slow and his interests so varied that he rarely completed
a project &mdash; it was abandoned as soon as he felt he had ‘solved the problem’. As
a result very few finished paintings by him exist.

He worked on the _Mona Lisa_ for nearly four years, and it was completed around 1503.
Mona comes from madonna meaning madam, and the woman is thought to be the
wife of the silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo (the picture is also
known as La Gioconda). She would have been about twenty-four when Leonardo
began her portrait. Her identity is not entirely certain &mdash; the painting itself
has few specific clues &mdash; and the power of the picture has probably been
enhanced by the mystery surounding it.

We know the figure was framed originally by two stone columns as well as by the
parapet behind her. Her body is turned at a slight angle and her eyes gaze
directly towards us. Her strangely enigmatic expression has fascinated the
world for hundreds of years. Her lips show the trace of a smile and her
penetrating eyes under heavy lids appear to be studying us rather than the
other way around.

A wide forehead, and eyebrows plucked to the point of invisibility, were marks
of beauty in the Renaissance world, and her hair parted in the centre and drawn
away from her face accentuates these features and heightens her air of
composure. Chestnut curls falling to her shoulders are covered by a veil of
fine gauze. Her hands are folded in her lap, and her long delicate fingers rest
on the shining folds of her dress.

An imaginary landscape provides a muted backcloth. Its jagged bare mountains,
dissected by a river and a winding road, tower starkly over the sea, and its
wildness and hostility provide a marked contrast to the calm face of the woman.

The paint is applied with fine detailed brushwork that reveals the textures of
drapery, hair and flesh. The evening light and the sombre colours of the
woman’s classically simple dress throw her face and neck into relief. Leonardo
believed that twilight provided the perfect atmosphere for portraits, warming
skin tones and softening the contours of a face.

By the time he painted the _Mona Lisa_ Leonardo’s reputation was firmly
established. He reached unequalled heights in an age of great artistic
achievement, and his paintings and drawings have been copied and circulated
ever since. The _Mona Lisa_ has undoubtedly become the most famous picture in the
world.
