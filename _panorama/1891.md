Earth lies a violin to my bow:  
And as I rush,  
A thousand shapes of music grow  
Out of the hush.  

The leaping flame within me draws,  
As it shoots lone,  
Between each throbbing pause and pause.  
Tone upon tone.  

Strange orchestrated sounds unroll  
From waiting woods;  
And as my passion thrills the soul  
Of solitudes,  

I hear a far-off rapture sweep  
Me as I pass;  
Loud waters dying in the deep,  
Low sighs of grass;  

Long echoes rolling to the ridge,  
Or valley green;  
The different notes of tunnel, bridge,  
Or cleft ravine;  

The fury of neglected stations&mdash;  
A shrieking wind  
Shrill with a million execrations  
Of hag or fiend;  

The murmurous silence when I stop,  
Live with the noise  
Of water drowsing drop by drop  
Or human voice.  

A little pause, and off I go...  
My simple art  
Touches to music with my bow  
Earth's silent heart.
