_Munnar - Devikulam - Pooppara - Theni - Periyakulam - Kodaikkanal_

 The rain wasn't showing signs of letting up, but we didn't let it bother us. The weather had its plans, we had ours. No one's stopping for the other. We left shortly after breakfast, and rode on towards Kodaikkanal.

> Once more, with feeling.

 This stretch had a bit of everything. Pouring rain &amp; blazing sun, dense fog and clear skies, winding ghat roads and flat plains.  The road even wound through a minor forest fire of sorts. Everything was ablaze on either side of the road.

 We reached Kodaikkanal in the afternoon with the whole town shrouded in thick fog. A good hour spent in finding a place to stay paid rich dividends!  We got this awesome isolated cottage with a complete valley in its backyard.

 Kodaikkanal off season is frequented purely by honeymooners. We stuck out like sore thumbs. We did a bit of sight-seeing, but not many photographs because of the failing light.

> This is one of the sights about the place. It's called &quot;Suicide point&quot; or something, my memory fails me.
