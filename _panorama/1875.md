Her eyes the glow-worm lend thee,  
The shooting stars attend thee;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the elves also,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose little eyes glow  
Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.  

No Will-o'-th'-Wisp mis-light thee,  
Nor snake or slow-worm bite thee;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But on, on thy way,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not making a stay,  
Since ghost there's none to affright thee.  

Let not the dark thee cumber;  
What though the moon does slumber?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars of the night  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will lend thee their light,  
Like tapers clear without number.  

Then Julia let me woo thee,  
Thus, thus to come unto me;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when I shall meet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy silv'ry feet,  
My soul I'll pour into thee.<br />
