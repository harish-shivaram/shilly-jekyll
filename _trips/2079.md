On the twelfth, we packed off Ranga and Chaithra's bikes, and             they were all set to fly back. My flight was with Adrian, Sam             and Arun, on the 19th. Plenty of time yet. I hit the road again,             late in the afternoon, and headed straight towards Rajasthan.             First halt, at the alma mater, BITS Pilani.

Most uncharacteristically, it started pouring soon as I got             closer to Rajasthan. By the time I reached Pilani, it was about             8PM, and my battery was flat by using the fog lamp. I checked             into the Alumni Guest house. The first time I have ever utilised             its services as an alumnus.

The next morning, the sun gave some brief and watery light 		  before being drowned in all the rain. Here are a few shots I took 		  around campus, things which have changed, and things that have 		  not. Please excuse, while I delve into an orgy of quaint BITSian 		  slang from way back.

>  The Coop! That dingy shed behind the MC (medical 		  center/makeup center) is long gone, and replaced by this grand 		  building.  _Change: Better_

>  Inside The Coop is a a regular supermarket. 		  &quot;Potato Chips on aisle 3&quot;. &quot;Checkout counter 5 items or less only&quot;. 		  And regular full-time loki employees, not EWYLP scheming idiots. 		  _Change: Better_

>  The Vyas jail. They've sealed up the whole ground 		  floor corridors on all sides. Look at the grill and stuff. The only 		  way to enter is through the central archway. I lived 2 years of my 		  life in this hostel, in rooms 234 and 282, and now it looks like a 		  maximum security wing in Central Jail. _Change: Definitely 			  Worse_

>  Gandhi, without his usual dosage of Crow's 		  revenge. It must be the rains. He looks clean only twice a year. 		  October 2nd and on the day it rains. _Change: None, really 		  _
