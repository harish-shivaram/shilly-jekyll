Late that morning, Prashi and I start riding up the road             towards Munsiyari. We had no luggage except for our cameras, but             that didn't make the ride any easier. We had numerous water             crossings to negotiate all morning, and the steep and winding             ghat roads tired us very fast. Still the view was, for want of a             better word, breath-taking.

Two hours and many water crossings later, we reached a pass             through the mountains. This was Kala Muni, a mere 19km from             Birthi, a little more than half-way to Munsiyari from Birthi. A             small tea-shop and a dilapidated temple were all that marked the             place. Well into cloud cover, visibility was pretty poor, and             the place was quite chill too.

Further ahead, the nice pucca road gave way to a kuchcha mud             road, when Prashi and I decided we'd had enough, and turned             back. It took us 2 hours, in bright daylight, without luggage,             to reach Kala Muni. Our snap decision to stay in Birthi the             previous day was nothing short of brilliant.
