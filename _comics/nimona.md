Notorious villain &mdash; Ballister Blackheart &mdash; gets a new sidekick to help him wreak havoc, obtain vengeance, and fight the Institution. But his new sidekick, Nimona, is an impulsive shapeshifter with a mysterious past and a her own. Plus, he also has a love/hate relationship with his friend-turned-nemesis &mdash; Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin.

This is a fun, quick read with a lot of heart: featuring a villain who likes to play by the rules; his spunky sidekick who, well... doesn't; their "good-guy" arch-nemesis; and an organization of heroes that may be less heroic than it appears. Sir Ballister and Nimona set out to expose Sir Ambrosius and the Institution, causing absolute mayhem along the way.

The story starts as a whimsical, frivolous parody of traditional heroic notions of good and evil &mdash; and, with a sleight of hand, goes on to rework them as something entirely nuanced and authentic. What you’ll get is an interesting romp that is equal parts witty humor, action-adventure, and pathos soaked drama. 

The art perfectly suited the tone of the story, and the rich and contrasting colors made the artwork stand out in the best ways.

If you're looking for a humorous adventure that gets surprisingly deep, don't miss out on “Nimona”.
