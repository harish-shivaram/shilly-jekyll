When I was about six or so, I was just learning to read. There was a public library two doors down from my house, and they had a collection of dog-eared Tintin albums.

They were my favourite! I couldn't follow the stories much, but the pictures, the art was what drew me in. He was doing so many things. Planes, cars, ships, motorbikes! Submarines! Swords, guns and knives. Oceans, mountains, deserts, jungles. "Titin", as I called him then, was the greatest comic book ever written.

I have since learned how to read, and expanded my scope to include several comics, but I still believe Tintin was one of the greatest.
