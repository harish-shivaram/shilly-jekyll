> From Udhamalpettai we went on towards Mariyur and reached the forest              check-post. Just in time, it would seem. They don't allow vehicles              inside the sanctuary after 6. It was beautiful single lane forest              ride inside the national part. The ride was totally awesome, as can  	    be seen from the pictures taken.

> The TN - Kerala border is separated by the Chinar river, with a bridge              over it. This river runs right through the national park. The bridge              was down. No 4 wheelers could go through. Fortunately for us, there              was a metre wide iron foot bridge, which comfortably accommodated  	    our rides.
