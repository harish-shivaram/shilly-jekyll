It's all very well to have a nifty blog, but it isn't too much fun if you don't have people reading it and commenting on it.&nbsp; You might as well just write in a gilt-edged, leather bound book with a page for every date.   

Now, from what I can gather on the net, there are a few ways you can get people to read Ze Blog.

1. Include a link in the e-mail signature, so people you exchange mails with would see the blog. That would be the first part of the &quot;awareness&quot; campaign.
1. Post in communities and forums and refer to articles in your blog. A sneaky way which seems like blowing your own trumpet, but that just a matter of perspective.
1. The easy way would be to sign up with some search engine, like <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a> 

Personally, I think it's a little early for me to try any of the above. This is my second blog entry, for crying out loud! I'm going to hold off until I get this place in order. Pending tasks are:

1.  Fill in more reviews into the movie database
1.  Bring the movie database up to date.
1.  Put in the classical music encyclopedia.    

Once the done above, at least there's useful content for people to read, not a couple of bland blog entries.
