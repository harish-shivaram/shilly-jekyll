What happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? 

Bacigalupi paints a terrifying and whole probable future in this SciFi (or is it CliFi? Climate Fiction?) biopunk novel. In a future where climate change and corporate greed are rampant, the world is on the brink of famine as a biological war is being waged between agriculatural mega-corporations (AgriGen companies) using gene-hacked seeds and mutant pests.

The solitary hold-out from the world-wide mayhem is Thailand, which is where the story is set. Thailand maintains their own seedbank, and has thus far resisted the efforts of the AgriGen companies. Multiple characters have independent goals as their lives and needs intertwine in a complex web full of political and corporate intrigue. At the centre of it all is Emiko, the titular "Windup Girl", an engineered human being created as a servant or companion.

There are so many new concepts in the book like "Kink-Springs", the successor to batteries and motors. These springs are "wound" using beasts genetically designed for the purpose. The springs are then used to drive things like dirigibles, cars or even elevators.

A spectacular book and a true-bluie science fiction which makes the reader wonder and think. A must read.
