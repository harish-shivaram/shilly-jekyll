Condemn'd to hope's delusive mine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As on we toil from day to day,   
By sudden blasts, or slow decline,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our social comforts drop away.  

Well tried through many a varying year,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Levet to the grave descend;   
Officious, innocent, sincere,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of ev'ry friendless name the friend.  

Yet still he fills affection's eye,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind;   
Nor, letter'd arrogance, deny  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy praise to merit unrefin'd.  

When fainting nature call'd for aid,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hov'ring death prepar'd the blow,   
His vig'rous remedy display'd  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of art without the show.  

In misery's darkest caverns known,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His useful care was ever nigh,   
Where hopeless anguish pour'd his groan,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lonely want retir'd to die.  

No summons mock'd by chill delay,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No petty gain disdain'd by pride,   
The modest wants of ev'ry day  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The toil of ev'ry day supplied.  

His virtues walk'd their narrow round,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor made a pause, nor left a void;   
And sure th' Eternal Master found  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The single talent well-employ'd.  

The busy day, the peaceful night,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfelt, uncounted, glided by;   
His frame was firm, his powers were bright,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tho' now his eightieth year was nigh.  

Then with no throbbing fiery pain,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No cold gradations of decay,   
Death broke at once the vital chain,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And free'd his soul the nearest way.
