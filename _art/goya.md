The artistic career of the Spanish artist Goya was long and successful. He was
principal painter to King Charles iv of Spain and director of the Spanish Royal
Academy, and prodigiously gifted as a draughtsman, print-maker and painter.  He
was born in Saragossa, had a conventional apprenticeship in art, and became
known principally as a painter of portraits and of the horrors of war.

His portraits are often devastatingly candid, and so caustic in their portrayal
of the corruption and arrogance of the Spanish monarchy that it is surprising
his commissions continued. He criticized violently the cruelty, hypocrisy and
stupidity that surrounded him; and in a series of prints called The Disasters
of War he revealed the savage brutality of Napoleon’s forces when they took
over Spain in 1808. But he had another side which came to the fore in his
sensual and subtle portraits of women, indicating the immense scope of his
talent. He became the greatest Spanish painter between Velazquez and Picasso,
and one of the greatest artists in Europe.

_The Third of May_ is one of a pair of paintings which together depict two days
in the short-lived uprising of the people of Madrid against the French troops in
the Napoleonic Wars. The paintings were commissioned a few years after the
event, with the command to the artist to ‘perpetuate with his brush the most
notable and heroic actions or events of our glorious insurrection against the
tyrant of Europe’; and Goya has produced two of the most electrifying and
dramatic works in European art.

This painting depicts the second day, when Spanish civilians were executed by
the invading army in the aftermath of the fighting. The group of Spaniards
cowering in panic in front of a French firing squad are depicted with
horrifying realism: the dead body slumped on the ground, the pool of blood and
the expressions of the victims are all shown with a shocking intensity. They
are portrayed not as heroes of war, but as ordinary frightened men, pleading
for their lives and showing disbelief, terror and even a sort of crazed bravado
in the face of death.

Our attention is focused on the central figure by means of various devices:
Goya has painted him, and the figures surrounding him, considerably larger in
proportion to their executioners than they would be in reality; the massacre is
taking place at night by the harsh light of a lantern and the kneeling man’s
white shirt reflects its glare; the soldiers are shooting at point-blank range;
and the man’s pose, with arms outstretched, is extremely eye- catching and
dramatic. These tactics of composition and lighting heighten the drama and
fear, and reveal Goya at his most passionate.
