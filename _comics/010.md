Imagine a steam-punk world at the end of 19th century, inhabited by the heroes and anti-heroes created by the authors of the Victorian era: Poe, Doyle, RL Stevenson, Stoker, Verne, Wells, Haggard, Wilde. And then this unlikely band of misfits are banded together to fight a greater enemy... absolute gold!

I cannot stress how much I enjoyed reading this series of graphic novels. The references to the books and characters that have piqued my childhood imagination now all come together, and work together? Oh wow wow wow wow.

I also loved the way Alan Moore brought in some interesting angles: the group is led by a woman, Wilhelmina Harker (nee Murray), from Bram Stoker's seminal work. Captain Nemo from 20,000 leagues and Mysterious Island is decidedly Indian... Of course, the books do hint at the same. Allan Quartermain is an opium addicted drunk hobo, and Mr. Hyde is... funny?

Good story, splendid art, great prose and wonderful characters make for a great story. Strongly recommend.
