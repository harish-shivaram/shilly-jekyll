>  Ranga takes on a water crossing. All four of us             struggled through the edge of this crossing, when a local on a             TVS Victor cruised right through the centre. So that's how it             should have been done!

We had lunch at a small village on the way. The menu there             consists of three things:

- Maggi noodles
- Cornflakes with milk
- Eggs to order


I made do with some Maggi and boiled eggs, while the veggie             boys (Ranga and Chaithra) subsisted on Maggi alone.
