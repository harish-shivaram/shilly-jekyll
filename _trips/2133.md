_Bangalore - Hosur - Krishnagiri - Dharmapuri - Thoppur 	    - Bhavani - Palladam - Udhamalpettai - Maraiyur - Munnar 	_

 We left early Thursday morning at about 5:45 from pizza corner on 	Hosur road in Koramangala. We rode straight on down Hosur road, through Krishnagiri and on. We took a diversion before Salem, the Mettur dam route to Bhavani. This cut out Salem and Erode and then on to Udhamalpettai.

 The first 2/3's of the ride was was uneventful, almost boring.  One interesting thing we saw was a wind farm just before Udhamalpettai. There were these HUGE windmills, with massive rotors. They made a deep low &quot;whoosh&quot; on every revolution. Now consider that there were hundreds of these!
