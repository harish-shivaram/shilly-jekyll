This book is in a genre by itself, a unique perspective on human folly that combines elements of science fiction, satire and fable, while discussing the horrors of war. Pick a genre, and put this book there, it will fit.

The story follows Billy Pilgrim, a young college student who gets conscripted for WWII, but even before he can take up his post, he is forced to start running to escape the advancing Germans. He is captured after a series of misadventures, and is one of the few PoW's to live though the horrific firebombing of Dresden. But the most interesting thing that happens to him is that he becomes unstuck in time. He is able to see his whole life, that which has been and that which will be, all at once.

Beyond this point, the book switches to a non-linear story telling structure, with consecutive passages referring to his childhood, as a respected optometrist and as a human oddity in an alien zoo.

The book has no structure or at the very least a perceivable one: it’s all over the place. But, it works so well. It cements the book’s message and purpose underlining its meaning. Indeed, this book is an anti-war novel, which is asserted (in part) through its random and confusing organisation. The story is “jumbled and jangled” such as the meaning of war. It appears pointless to the reader, again alluding to the meaning of war. It also suggests that after the war a soldier’s life is in ruins and has no clear direction, which can be seen with the sad case of Billy Pilgrim.

If for nothing else, the below passage makes this book an absolute must read.

> “America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.
>
> Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. The most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.”

There is no better way to describe this book except as “bizarre”. The narrative is random and confusing. But despite that, this book shall remain one of the best anti-war books ever written.
