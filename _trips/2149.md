 A comedy of errors as the day started. Joy and I waited at the main circle while everybody took off with a personal agenda (chocolates, oil, petrol...). When a no show happened, we headed out of the town thinking we'd misunderstood the rendezvous. There Joy asked around and &quot;discovered&quot; that bikers had already passed by. Whoa!

 Joy and I negotiated the very tricky 23 hair-pin-bend route from Ooty to Masinagudi. And then on to Bandipur. It was here that we first realised that the others were probably behind us. Note to self: Never let Joy handle investigations in the future.

 We descended We had lunch at Nanjangud, and waited for an hour, but obviously, the others were too far behind. To alleviate the boredom, we rode on to Mysore and waited some more. The whole group was re-united here with shouts of &quot;What were you guys thinking&quot; and &quot;Couldn't you have waited&quot;.

 The rest of the journey on the Bangalore-Mysore road was uneventful, and mostly boring. The boys ate the bird at Channapatna (whatzit ? a partridge ?). We stopped at &quot;The Club&quot; just outside the city before we parted ways towards home. Rather the long way around from &quot;Pizza Corner&quot; to &quot;The Club&quot;.
