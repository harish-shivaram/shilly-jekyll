>  Sky lawns, completely unchanged. Still have the 		  amoeba, and the horseshoe. But you will notice that the lawns are 		  completely devoid of trippers, and couples. I optimistially blame 		  that on the rain.  _Change: None, and that's good_

>  The sundial and the sky pond. Water looking 		  cleaner that I'd ever seen it. Hey, but where is everybody. 10:30 		  AM on a boring tuesday, half of Malaviya would be hanging out 		  here._Change: Really good_

>  The Audi. Never realised back then how grand it 		  actually looks. _Change: Only my perception_
