	<dt>Baroque</dt>
	<dd><p>The Baroque Period, 1600&mdash;1750</p>

<p>Baroque was a style that was characterised by a tendency to decorate and embellish.  It is also seen as an expressive period, though not in an emotional sense (as with the Romantic era), but rather where, although there were still rules to follow creatively, brilliant and sparkling art was produced.</p>

<p>In architecture, designs went up on a grand scale, with constructions such as the Palace of Versailles near Paris and the piazza in Rome by Bernini, who was considered the leading Baroque sculptor.  In music, composers such as Vivaldi, Bach and Handel were producing compositions that would serve to inspire nearly all those that followed them, though, contrary to what one might think, they themselves did not just sit around waiting to be inspired.  Most of the composers of the time were in the employ of patrons, usually aristocrats or religious leaders who required works to be written for special occasions and events.  Bach, for example, was contractually obliged to produce almost one new work every week, and Handel wrote pieces such as his famous 'Water Music' while composing for the King of England.</p>

<p>Chamber music was the popular format of the time, with a concentration on strings as a rule. Although orchestras were occasionally used, a concert was usually performed to a private (and probably very rich) audience by a few musicians.  The piano as we know it today had not yet been invented, and the popular instrument was the harpsichord.  This produced sounds of the same volume regardless of how hard a key was hit, and the result was music whose volume did not vary as much as Classical or Romantic, and was therefore less emotional.  However it was expressive, bright and energetic with an intelligent feel that made the whole Baroque movement an influential and important period in music.</p></dd>

	<dd>The beginning (da capo: from the beginning)</dd>
	<dt>Capriccio</dt>
	<dd>A piece in a free, light-hearted style</dd>
	<dt>Cassation</dt>
	<dd><p>No musician has ever been able to clearly define exactly what a 'cassation' is, only that it is closely related to a 'suite' and a 'sonata' in terms of its movement structure.</p>

<p>Some take a definition from the French verb 'casser' meaning 'to break', as a cassation was often played over an entire evening with the movements being broken up. Others point to the Italian word 'cassa' meaning 'drum', connecting this with the opening 'march' movement.</p>

<p>However, the derivation may be from an old Austrian dialect expression, 'gassatim gehen', which means to roam about at night courting and serenading girls at their windows.</p></dd>
	<dt>Cavatina</dt>
	<dd>A short vocal piece, a little like an aria</dd>
	<dt>Classical</dt>
	<dd><p>The Classical Period, 1750&mdash;1827</p>

<p>As a rule, when people talk about 'classical music' they are usually referring to any music that is played by orchestras and musicians wearing white tie and tails, or any other 'serious' music that doesn't automatically fall into the specific categories of pop, rock, jazz, ethnic or new age.  However, this is not strictly the case. The term actually describes the music that was written between 1750 and 1827 encompassing the works of composers such as Mozart and Beethoven, although the umbrella title encompasses many different styles: Baroque, Romantic, Impressionistic and Nationalistic schools are just a few examples.  The great masters of the Classical period are Mozart, Haydn, Schubert and Beethoven and there is no doubt that, without them, the music of today would be very different.  Their works have formed the standard repertoire of classical musicians around the world for the last hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>By 1750, the orchestra had come into its own as a medium for which it was worth writing music and, with the invention of the modern pianoforte (literally meaning 'soft-loud' ) in 1709, composers found that they could produce increasingly expressive and varied music which could then be orchestrated and performed.  Music became more dramatic and emotional, with powerful instrumental displays being the norm.</p>

<p>By listening to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, for example, one can get an idea of the basics of the Classical period and appreciate how it differs from other categories of music.  Because the term definitely describes its own particular era it proves that one cannot simply sum up largely different styles with the word 'classical'.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>Modern Music 1910&mdash;</p>

<p>Unlike the Baroque, Romantic and Classical periods, the Modern era is both one of the hardest and the easiest periods of musical history to define.  In terms of time-scale it is easy, being simply all the music that has been written since roughly 1910;  in terms of the actual music itself, explanation becomes more difficult.</p>

<p>The styles of the prominent composers are massively varied, ranging from the blues-influenced work of Gershwin to Berg's minimalist First Symphony, or from Bart&#243;k's nationalistic folk music to Stravinsky's wild and turbulent The Rite of Spring.</p>

<p>What can safely be said, however, is that it was at this time that music really began to change, with numerous composers experimenting and developing new ideas and approaches in order to throw off the restrictive chains of previous times.  New instruments were introduced and and orchestration began to be transformed, with composers such as Schoenberg redefining the previously accepted 'scales' and 'tonal' patterns, influencing others, such as Berg, to progress to newer and more daring musical techniques.  More importantly, attitudes began to change and people became more prepared to give time to new styles.</p>

<p>Currently, we live in the age of electronic music, where actual music production has become simpler than ever before with computers playing a large role.  As a result, it could be said that for the first time there are no rules left in music, rendering the future delightfully unpredictable.</p></dd>

	<dd><p>The Romantic Period, 1800&mdash;1910</p>

<p>In literature, art and music, Romanticism is seen as being a style that puts an emphasis on the imagination, emotions and creativity of the individual artist, and it was most popular in the nineteenth century.  It was inspired, to a large extent, by social change in Europe and the United States, resulting in a reaction to the traditional restraints of the previous Classical era.</p>

<p>The early Romantics wished to stress through their art the importance of how the individual feels about the world, either natural or supernatural.  It was also a nostalgic movement, with artists looking back to an imagined idyllic past of breath-taking landscapes, natural beauty and sanitised historical scenes.</p>

<p>Musically, there was a preoccupation with nationalistic roots and folk music, with composers such as Jan&#225;cek and Grieg drawing heavily on the culture of their countries for inspiration.  Emotion, however, was the popular theme of the time, and it was here that we began to see the emergence of the 'sensitive artist'.  It became acceptable for people, especially men, to express themselves in ways in which a restrictive society had previously prevented them from doing.  Thus it was that Chopin might burst into tears while reading a particularly moving poem, or Berlioz would run through the Italian countryside laughing his head off from sheer ecstasy.</p>

<p>Many operas and ballets were written at this time, usually based on classic or mythological tales.  It was a great period of experimentation and therefore it is difficult to define its end correctly, as the transition from Romantic to Modern was a vague one with huge overlaps.  Nevertheless, the Romantic period as a whole was essential to the development of European music as it suddenly made possible a whole new range of expression to emerge, resulting in some incredibly powerful and moving works.</p></dd>
