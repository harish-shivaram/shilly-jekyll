>  The road to Sonamarg 

Zoji La is open to traffic only after 2PM, so we slept till             late in the morning. We left the houseboat at about 10:30, and             rode to Sonamarg. We reached Sonamarg at lunch time as the road             was good throughout. We still had soldiers every 100m, but had             got used to them by now. At Sonamarg, there is a diversion to             Amarnath, but the road less travelled was our road, the road to             Zoji La. For the first time, at Sonamarg, we felt the chill, the             real Himalayan chill. It's cold in the shade, but the skin burns             in the sun.

>  Zoji La! Those two lines are the roads we rode             on. We ride up one, all the way to the end, take a hairpin bend,             and then ride up the other. To give you an idea of the scale,             there actually is a convoy of trucks on the lower road, on the             right side of the picture. You can locate it if you look             closely. 

We started up Zoji La at about 1:30 PM. The road condition             deteriorated. My carburettors were still set rich for the             plains, and in the thin air, my engine just couldn't burn fuel             properly. It struggled to pull up Zoji La, and grunted and             groaned until Prashi pulled out a screw driver and opened out             the air screws three-quarter turns. From then on, it was just             _Caman the Zoji La_.

>  The river Bheend. The road goes along this river             from Ganderbal right up to Kargil.

>  The incredible RD alongside the incomparable             Himalayas. Jokes about the extra fuel on the carrier will NOT be             appreciated!
