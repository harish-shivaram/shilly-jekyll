The whole road, from Hunder, was completely deserted. Not just             of traffic, of people too. Except for the occasional stallion,             there was absolutely no signs of life anywhere in Nubra valley.             We learned the reason for this at Khalsar: Khardung La is closed             on Mondays. Some wise-ass district commissioner who really hated             the Monday morning blues must have declared this. Ah well, good             for him. There's no stopping bikers anyway.

Just a couple of hairpin bends below Khardung La, we ran into             a huge slush pit, which was a good 2 feet deep to boot. It took             us a good half an hour to get the RD350 through. While we             struggled, a group of BRO workers came with a bulldozer. As soon             as we managed to get the RD across, the dozer made a few sweeps             across the pit, and the remaining three bikes got across easily.
