- 12th to 14th of August
- Bangalore to New Delhi

On the evening of 12th, we staged a live performance of &quot;A             Comedy of Errors&quot;. I loaded my stuff into my Jeep, drove to             Prashi's and picked him up along with his luggage. Then I drove             back to my place to pick up my bike keys, and got to the railway             station with about 15 minutes to spare. Close Call !!!

Quite a sizable crowd had assembled to see us off. Mani and             Rajiv from office, Anthony and Janardhan from my garage, and             Sukesh, Sam, Adrian, Grease, Lloyd, Vijay, Easha and Mahendra --             in short, all the usual suspects from RTMC (_Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Club_). Sandy, who was             supposed to be on the train with us, but opted to fly instead,             was at the station too. Rather sweet of them to interrupt their             Friday night drinking binges to see us off.

A fairly uneventful journey with interesting company saw us             through the next 36 hours. A media man from Nagpur, a civil             servant from Rajasthan, a twenty-something girl into &quot;clinical             research&quot; and a housewife from New Delhi listened patiently as             Prashi and I rattled on about bikes and touring.

We reached Hazrat-Nizamuddin on time, and quite a few palms             had to be greased to get our bikes out of he station. We reached             hotel Sahara International in Pahargang at about 4:30. This             hotel, an old time favourite with bikers, wasn't so friendly             this time as the basement parking had been let out to a clinic.             Sandy had reached earlier that day, and had already checked in.

That evening, we spent in the company of Arun Madaan. Madaan             rents motorcycles for touring, and we availed his services to             procure a red Lightning 535 for Sandy. Although supplied with             &quot;Full Papers&quot;, the bike was essentially uninsured, as Madaan             used a ball-point pen to change the date on the expired             insurance policy.
