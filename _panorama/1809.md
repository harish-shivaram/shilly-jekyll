I had a Hippopotamus, I kept him in a shed  
And fed him upon vitamins and vegetable bread  
I made him my companion on many cheery walks  
And had his portrait done by a celebrity in chalk  

His charming eccentricities were known on every side  
The creatures' popularity was wonderfully wide  
He frolocked with the Rector in a dozen friendly tussles  
Who could not but remark on his hippopotamuscles  

If he should be affected by depression or the dumps  
By hippopotameasles or the hippopotamumps  
I never knew a particle of peace 'till it was plain  
He was hippopotamasticating properly again  

I had a Hippopotamus, I loved him as a friend  
But beautiful relationships are bound to have an end  
Time takes alas! our joys from us and rids us of our blisses  
My hippopotamus turned out to be a hippopotamisses  

My house keeper regarded him with jaundice in her eye  
She did not want a colony of hippotami  
She borrowed a machine gun from from her soldier nephew, Percy  
And showed my hippopotamus no hippopotamercy  

My house now lacks that glamour that the charming creature gave  
The garage where I kept him is now as silent as the grave  
No longer he displays among the motor tyres and spanners  
His hippopomastery of hippopotamanners  

No longer now he gambols in the orchards in the spring  
No longer do I lead him through the village on a string  
No longer in the morning does the neighbourhood rejoice  
To his hippopotamusically-modulated voice.  

I had a hippopotamus but nothing upon earth  
Is constant in its happines or lasting in its mirth  
No joy that life can give me can be strong enough to smother  
My sorrow for that might-have-been-a-hippopota-mother
