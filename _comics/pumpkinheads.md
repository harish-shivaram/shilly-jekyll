Deja and Josiah are seasonal best friends.

Every autumn, all through high school, they’ve worked together at the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world. (Not many people know that the best pumpkin patch in the whole wide world is in Omaha, Nebraska, but it definitely is.) They say good-bye every Halloween, and they’re reunited every September 1.

But this Halloween is different—Josiah and Deja are finally seniors, and this is their last season at the pumpkin patch. Their last shift together. Their last good-bye.

Josiah’s ready to spend the whole night feeling melancholy about it. Deja isn’t ready to let him. She’s got a plan: What if—instead of moping and the usual slinging lima beans down at the Succotash Hut—they went out with a bang? They could see all the sights! Taste all the snacks! And Josiah could finally talk to that cute girl he’s been mooning over for three years . . .

Deja convinces shy Josiah to go talk to her, but it turns out that ‘fudge girl’ is harder to track than they thought. What starts as a mission to find ‘fudge girl’ turns into a night of adventure. 

This is a very cute read with a gentle romance built in. Deja and Josie were both lovable. Deja is the kind of friend everyone needs... funloving and caring, but (for the most part) still isn't afraid to say what she feels. Deja's more of an extrovert as she's been around the block a time or two, whereas Josie is more introverted and unsure of himself. They make a great pair, accepting one another for who they are. Friendship is a beautiful theme throughout.

The illustrations are gorgeous, which really bring out the autumnal atmosphere and the characters' emotions. A quick read and leaves one warm and fuzzy.
