description: A book that is as brutal and honest as its title. This is like a handbook of reference for any atheist for the range of illogical, childish or even intelligent theist arguments that might be addressed to him.

A preeminent scientist - and the world's most prominent atheist - asserts the irrationality of belief in God, and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11.

With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament, to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.

The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.

A common argument I've encountered is 'if you don't believe in god, then what's to stop you stealing, raping, and killing as often as you like?" And of course, I do steal, rape, and kill as often as I like to--which is not at all.

However, if you turn the question around, it has very unflattering implications for the believer who asked it: 'Are you saying the only thing preventing you from violating and killing strangers is your belief in god? That most of the time, you're sitting there fantasizing about murder, and the only thing stopping you is fear of divine punishment?'

A must read, no matter what your religious beliefs may be. This book will put things in perspective and make the reader think... hard.
