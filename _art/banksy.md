Banksy is a pseudonymous England-based street artist, political activist and
film director whose real name and identity remain unconfirmed and the subject
of speculation. Active since the 1990s, his satirical street art and
subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti executed in a distinctive
stenciling technique. 

Banksy displays his art on publicly visible surfaces such as walls and
self-built physical prop pieces. Banksy no longer sells photographs or
reproductions of his street graffiti, but his public "installations" are
regularly resold, often even by removing the wall they were painted on.

_Girl with Balloon_ (also known as _Balloon Girl_ or _Girl and Balloon_) is a
series of stencil murals around London started in 2002.  They depict a young
girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped balloon carried away by
the wind. The locations for this work include street murals in Shoreditch and
the South bank in London on the Waterloo Bridge[1] and other murals were around
London, though none remain there. 

In 2018, a 2006 framed copy of the artwork was auctioned at Sotheby's. Moments
after the closing bid, the artwork began to self-destruct by means of a hidden
mechanical paper shredder that Banksy had built into the frame bottom. Only the
lower half shredded. Banksy released an image of the shredding on Instagram
with the words "Going, going gone..". The partially shredded work has been
given a new title, _Love Is in the Bin_.
