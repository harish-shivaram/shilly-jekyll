Andy Weir's follow up to Martian. Earth has established a lunar colony, which is built largely from aluminium, mined from the lunar regolith itself. Oxygen is a byproduct of this mining, and a small colony flourishes, supporting the tourist industry and the eccentric billionaires who call the Moon home. The main character, Jazz Bashara, is a porter/smuggler, whose father is part of the welding team which built the colony. 

The plot involves multiple parties fighting for control of the mining operation. There is delightful detail about life on the colony and the mining operation, but the main character and her internal monologue is... rather bad. It is essentially the same character from Martian, but written as a woman. Unfortunately, that does not work.

On the whole, the book is not as strong as the Martian, but still fantastic on the hard science, making it an enjoyable read nonetheless.
