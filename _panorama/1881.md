She is not fair to outward view  
&nbsp;&nbsp;As many maidens be,  
Her loveliness I never knew  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she smiled on me;  
O, then I saw her eye was bright,  
A well of love, a spring of light!  

But now her looks are coy and cold,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To mine they ne'er reply,  
And yet I cease not to behold  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The love-light in her eye:  
Her very frowns are fairer far  
Than smiles of other maidens are.
