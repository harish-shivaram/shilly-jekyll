After spending about an hour on top, we headed back to             Joshimath. Gear up, check out, hit the road. The actions were             almost automatic now. From Joshimath, we headed down to Chamoli.             At Chamoli, we took a diversion from the highway to a state             road.

>  This is a road that's visible from Joshimath. I             guess it might be military access only. Those guys save the best             for themselves. It keeps winding up till it disappears into a             glacier on the top. 

The main roads in these areas are access roads to military             outposts on the border. They are maintained by a military wing             called the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The lesser used             roads are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD). In             Bangalore, the tourism PRO had warned us that the PWD roads are             usually in much worse shape than the BRO roads.

The road from Chamoli to Chopta was a PWD road, and we were             very pleasantly surprised. This road was way better than the BRO             maintained road from Chamoli to Joshimath. We would have done             good time too... except that it started pouring. Civilisation is             very sparse around these parts, and there is a good 10km between             tea shops on the road.

We reached Chopta early in the afternoon, when Prashi's bike             started misfiring from all the water in the air-filter. Sandy             found us a nice log cabin to stay in. Although it looked very             rickety, it was pretty cosy and, more importantly, didn't leak.             We slept comfortably though it kept raining right through the             evening and night.
