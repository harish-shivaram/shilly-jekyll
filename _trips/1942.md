> We spotted spotted deer (Hah! I was waiting to use that one) lazing by the highway, quite unafraid. I suppose diesel engines and lens-men are everyday sights to these gentle beasts.

You'll see a lot more of the red line now. It's a shutter problem which happens because of weak batteries. God, this is the last time I venture out without spares.

> We also saw quite a few wild dogs. These creatures look very much like foxes and move in fair-sized packs. They completely ignored our jeep, but moved away when I tried to get a closer shot. Sorry about the screwy shot that I did manage to get.

> We reached the park guides' office shortly before 2:00PM.  Safaris started at 3:00p, so to killed time we checked out this waterfall in a neighbouring national park. The falls were called Irpu falls, but I forgot the name of the park. Some Belangiri or something.

We stopped for lunch at a small village called Kutta on the Kerala border. No one spoke Kannada there, and the few conversations in my halting Mallu were awkward, to say the least. I really should make an effort to learn proper Mallu someday... it's my mother tongue after all.
