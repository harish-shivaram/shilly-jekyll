description: A romance involving a young girl and boy, both in remission from cancer, told from the perspective of the girl Hazel

Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten.

Insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw, The Fault in Our Stars is award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet, brilliantly exploring the funny, thrilling, and tragic business of being alive and in love.

The book is funny, sad and poignant at the same time. That said, the characters are... for want of a better word, grating. Teenagers, even those who are faced with their own mortality from a very young age, seem to be wise far beyond their years. It has an unnatural, contrived quality about it.

I want to draw a parallel to The Diary of Anne Frank. The Anne Frank Huis in Amsterdam plays a key role in this books plot. Anne's diary is written by a teen too, who also is forced to confront the mortality of herself and her entire community at a young age. But through her writing, she still remains a child, evinced by her ideas and her petulance, and the feeling that the adults just don't treat her thoughts with the gravity they should be.

I would like to say I enjoyed the book, but I am not sure I did.
