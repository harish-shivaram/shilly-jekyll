Hello.

 Just &quot;Hello&quot;. Just plain vanilla, run-of-the-mill &quot;Hello&quot;. I mean, can a greeting be more innocuous? It's not flighty, like a &quot;Hola&quot;, nor is it frivolous, like a &quot;Hey&quot;, nor is it excessively familiar, like a &quot;Hi&quot;. &nbsp;

 A proper stiff-necked greeting if ever there was one. &nbsp;And sadly enough, I was censured by my colleagues for using it as the opening line in an official e-mail to a customer. &nbsp;

 What is this world coming to? Ok, I know that there is something called propriety, etiquette, and a standard template for all this bureaucratic communication. &nbsp;

 But can't one just put in a simple &quot;Hello&quot;, just to be nice? It seems border-line rude to start off with &quot;Attached are the reports for blah blah...&quot;&nbsp;

 I protest against this. I will be nice. It's my style, my flair. My way of doing things. I will start official e-mails with a &quot;Hello&quot;. &nbsp;

 And these oaths of mine are purely academic, since I will also never be allowed to send an official e-mail henceforth.
