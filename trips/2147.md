_     Kodaikkanal - Palani - Udhamalpettai - Pollachi - Coimbatore -     Mettupalayam - Coonoor - Ooty _

  While Ligeo and Joy did an early morning disappearing act, the rest of us amused ourselves by doing the following, in no particular order.

- Drinking leftover booze.
- Taking photographs around the cottage
- Tightening Easha's bike chain.
- ... and in Vipin's case, hunting for bison dung! Don't ask!
