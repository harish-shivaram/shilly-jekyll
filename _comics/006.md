During WW2 Americans helped fight Europe's war, thereby elevating it to a world war. They also inadvertently exported their pop culture to Europe, espdcially the romantic idea of a cowboy on his horse, living a hard life on a lawless land meting out his own form of justice. This was seen in the immense popularity of Spaghetti westerns from Italy, and Lucky Luke, from France.

Lucky Luke is collaboration between writer Goscinny of Asterix fame and artist Morris. The main protagonist is Lucky Luke, a smart honest cowboy who is often roped in by various law enforcement agencies (Sheriffs, Pinkertons, Jailors, Governors, to name a few).

The whole series is fantastic, because
- the writing is on point, complete with thorough historical research,
- the artwork is outstanding,
- and it is just outrageously funny.

The humour is largely situational, and derives from both bumbling adversaries as well as the clever quips of Lucky's horse Jolly Jumper. There were several volumes in this series, definitely worth reading.
