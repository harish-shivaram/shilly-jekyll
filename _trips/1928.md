We reached Salem afore cockcrow. In scientific terms that would be about oh-five-one-five. And we promptly get lost in the deserted streets of pre-dawn Salem. A lone TVS 50 rider directed us, but his second left and third rights only served to confound us further, so he offered to lead us to the right path.

The few bleary-eyed early risers gawked at the extraordinary sight... a TVS 50 at the lead of a convoy of heavy loud motorcycles, all crawling at 20kmph.

> The road up is lined on either sides with many farms and plantations. The 23 kilometers of twisties to the top was a lined with trees and fences such as this. Kartz and I rode this stretch fast. Very fast.
