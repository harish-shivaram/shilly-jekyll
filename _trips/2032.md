- 24th of August
- _Joshimath - Auli - Joshimath - Chamoli - Gopeshwar -               Chopta_
- 125km


My legs were still out of commission when we hit the cable-car             station first thing in the morning. The whole ride from             Joshimath to Auli takes about 22 minutes. Huh, so much for the             longest cable car in Asia. On the way up, we saw the ski slopes             from the cable car. Although now they were lush green fields, in             winter they are covered up with 8-10 feet of snow.

>  More slopes, and a ski lift. This lift ferries             skiers from the bottom of the slopes to the lodge.
