John Anderson my jo, John,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were first acquent,  
Your locks were like the raven,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your bonny brow was brent;  
But now your brow is bled, John,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your locks are like the straw,  
But blessings on your frosty pow,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Anderson my jo!  

John Anderson my jo, John,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We clamb the hill thegither  
And monie a cantie day, John,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've had wi' ane anither;  
Now we maun totter down, John,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hand in hand we'll go,  
And sleep thegither at the foot,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Anderson my jo!<br />
