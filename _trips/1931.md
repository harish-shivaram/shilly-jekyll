title: Finding our way, back
excerpt: Now we did something odd on the way back. We avoided Salem entirely, and took another road down from Yercaud. This led us to a state highway which passed through the towns of Pallipatti and Harur, and eventually joined the Krishnagiri-Pondicherry National highway at Uttangarai. This route was a lot more scenic and had lesser traffic to boot. I've been to Yercaud over half a dozen times in the past four years, but I've never done this route again. We took a lot of photograph stops on the way.
