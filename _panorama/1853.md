title: Where the Mind is Without Fear
poem: true
author: Tagore, Rabindranath
---
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where knowledge is free;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where words come out from the depth of truth;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action--  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br />
