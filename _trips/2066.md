We reached Leh early in the afternoon. Sunder in Hunder had             recommended a Tongspon guest house on Fort Road in Leh, and we             spent some time hunting for this place. The place was definitely             worth it. The rooms were top quality and quite cheap, the place             clean and comfortable and the landlord was very nice and             friendly.

We spent the evening walking up and down the market road in             Leh. Did I mention that we ran into our cyclist friends yet             again! We had an extravagant dinner that evening in Leh, running             up the largest single bill of fare on this entire trip.
