This day was another day of all work and no play. We rode hard             from early in the morning, since we had to reach Joshimath by             the evening. Very few photographs were taken this day. Some             pretty good timing saw us having lunch in Chamoli.

Somewhere halfway, Sandy's Madaan Special broke a gear lever             spring. So the gear lever could not be used to change gears. The             only option was for Sandy to lean down, and change gears with             his hand, using the neutral finder. Initially it looked rather             awkward, but once Sandy got the hang of it, he handled very             well, in the ghats even. Prashi's clutch plates were slipping             too, and he struggled to push the bike in the twisty mountain             roads.

In spite of the pretty view, the condition of these roads was             quite bad. Tarmac showed up only occasionally, and even then was             riddled with pot-holes. Despite these, we did some pretty             spectacular time, and reached Joshimath in the afternoon, and             had time leftover to change the spring on Sandy's bike, clutch             plates on Prashi's bike and loaf around the town.
