It was a dark and stormy night.

Out of this wild night, a strange visitor comes to the Murry house and beckons
Meg, her brother Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin O'Keefe on a most
dangerous and extraordinary adventureâ€”one that will threaten their lives and
our universe.

All the characters are flat &mdash; the genius child, the misfit girl, the
beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew
in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures.  And then there are three
beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the "Darkness"
and became something beyond our comprehension. Essentially they are a Deus Ex
Machina, a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout
the Universe and the story. 

The story takes about 100 pages of tedious, banal dialogue, to get to the point
where you are told that this is a battle against Evil, and all you need is
love. But everything is so oversimplified, so sketchy &mdash; everything is
reduced to big words, like IT, and evil. This IT, also called the Dark Thing,
is striving to create a communist-type society where everyone conforms, down to
the little children who bounce their balls in uniform rhythms and who live in
cutter-box houses. 

And the so-called Darkness, Evil, IT... is essentially a disembodied brain, and
the main character defeats this brain by gushing love. There were undertones of
spiritual / religious indoctrination throughout the book. On the whole, it was
a tedious, patronizing and superficial story which was attempting to pass off
in equal parts as science fiction, fantasy and family fiction.

There were so many reviews praising this book to high heavens. I was thoroughly
disappointed.
