description: What is that thing that came through the breach?
---

Thirty years ago, in a facility buried beneath a vast Wyoming emptiness, an experiment gone awry accidentally opened a door. It is the world's best-kept secret-and its most terrifying. Trying to regain his life in the Alaskan wilds, ex-con/ex-cop Travis Chase stumbles upon an impossible scene: a crashed 747 passenger jet filled with the murdered dead, including the wife of the President of the United States.

Though a nightmare of monumental proportions, it pales before the terror to come, as Chase is dragged into a battle for the future that revolves around an amazing artifact. Allied with a beautiful covert operative whose life he saved, Chase must now play the role he's been destined for-a pawn of incomprehensible forces or humankind's final hope-as the race toward Apocalypse begins in earnest. Because something is loose in the world. And doomsday is not only possible... it is inevitable.

A throwback to the heyday of suspense thrillers, when Frederick Forsyth and Craig Thomas ruled supreme. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The plot was intricate, intelligent, and well-developed. Most of the key characters were well drawn. The writing was professional. I would recommend this novel to any lover of techno/scifi-thrillers.
