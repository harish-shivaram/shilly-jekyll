I was exposed to Asterix very early, when I was just learning to read. Unfortunately, it didn't make much of an impact then, because I simply was just too young.

The humour in Asterix derives from  multiple sources
- Clever use of language, especially puns
- Mocking stereotypes
- Situational
- Slapstick

The first three require an adult's world view to be fully appreciated, and they comprise the reason why Asterix is one of the best comics ever written. Once I was much older and re-read the albums, I was hooked. I have read each several times and each time I find something new to appreciate and be amused about.

The earlier Asterix story lines have a bit of silliness and the artwork was still evolving. It took Goscinny a few albums to hone his story telling skills, and Uderzo almost exactly as long to perfect the look of the characters and settings. From then on, the books were an absolute delight and a treat to read.

My first salary was spent in buying all the volumes available. I still believe this was the best use of the money.
