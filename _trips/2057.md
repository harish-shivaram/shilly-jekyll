>  The temple and souvenir shop at Khardung La.             Well, the souvenir shop is basically the wooden table to the             right of the temple. It's run by the military. -- Courtesy             Prashi 

Once you reach places like Khardung La, the best of us become             Patels. We literally raided the souvenir shop. I got a couple of             T-shirts, and the others got caps, hats, medals, key-chains...             at least one of everything that was stocked. After about an hour             there, we headed on towards North Pullu, and Nubra Valley.
