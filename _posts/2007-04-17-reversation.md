description: Is it really affirmative action when the effects are so negative?

Yep, it has reared its ugly head again. The Indian government are pushing for more affirmative action. Soon as a judicial bench clears it, the Indian government is implementing a 27 percent reservation for what is termed the &quot;_Other Backward Classes_&quot; in all higher degree professional education institutions.


<blockquote>
Let me take you on a little trip  
My supersonic ship's at your disposal  
If you feel so inclined. well alright.


</blockquote>
The government doesn't seem to realize that it is at cross purposes here. On the one hand, it has declared the caste system illegal.&nbsp; According to law, a person cannot be treated differently because of his or her race, colour, creed, belief or birth. I am unsure of the exact wording of this law, but that's about the gist of it.


<blockquote>
We're gonna travel faster than light  
So do up your overcoat tight  
And you'll go anywhere you want to decide. well alright.


</blockquote>
But then, the government itself is the one who is treating people differently based on their affiliation to what is euphemistically termed _classes_. If a person is _born_ into such a class of people, he has the right to avail of this &quot;reservation&quot;. So, aren't they contradicting themselves ? Aren't they breaking the law that they have laid down, and have been elected to uphold ?


<blockquote>
On my supersonic rocket ship  
Nobody has to be hip  
Nobody needs to be out of sight. out of sight.


</blockquote>
The way I see it, _<strong>Reservation</strong> is a <strong>reversal</strong> of the system_. <strong>While &quot;Affirmative action&quot; is intended to bring equality among people, what it actually does is highlight the inequality.</strong> For this very reason, the system has been done away with in almost all other parts of the world.


<blockquote>
Nobody's gonna travel second class  
There'll be equality  
And no suppression of minorities. well alright.


</blockquote>
I'd like to believe that I am beyond the reach of &quot;Reservation&quot;. Now that I'm a skilled labourer, and have a couple of honestly obtained degrees to back that up, I'd like to believe that I transcend reservation.   But the day may not be far off when I am denied a job because I, unfortunately, have not been born into a scheduled cast, a scheduled tribe or other backward classes.
