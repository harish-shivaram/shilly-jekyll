&nbsp;&nbsp; When God at first made man,  
Having a glass of blessings standing by;  
'Let us', said he, 'pour on him all we can:  
Let the world's riches, which dispersed lie,  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract into a span'.  

&nbsp;&nbsp; So strength first made a way;  
The beauty flowed, then wisdom, honour, pleasure:  
When almost all was out, God made a stay,  
Perceiving that alone of all his treasure  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest in the bottom lay.  

&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For if I should', said he,  
'Bestow this jewel also on my creature,  
He would adore my gifts instead of me,  
And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature:  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So both should losers be.  

&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yet let him keep the rest,  
But keep them with repining restlessness:  
Let him be rich and weary, that at least,  
If goodness lead him not, yet weariness  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May toss him to my breast.'<br />
