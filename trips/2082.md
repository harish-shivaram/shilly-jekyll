>  The booze shop. Nice big boards. They still have 		  that pig sty at the back where we have quaffed many a chill beer. 		  _Change: Very good_

>  Many, many brands are available now. Back in the 		  day, we just had Knockout beer, ACP whisky and Old Monk rum. 		  And 45 bucks a beer ?!? We used to pay 60, man.  _Change: Very 			  good_

Yeah, and then it started raining. It rained right through the 		  next 5 days, and I never took a single snap. Aah well, the next 		  time, mebbe. Gives me an excuse to go to Rajasthan again.

I need to do the city tours for each place. In Bikaner &amp; 		  Jodhpur, I just saw a couple of forts, a palace and a museum of some 		  sort. I kept riding though long straight highway roads, with desert 		  sands on both sides and continuous rain. Repeat ad nauseum, until I 		  reached Delhi.

Evening of the 17th, I'm in the outskirts of Gurgaon in a 		  traffic jam, when my clutch cable gives up the ghost. I rode 		  without a clutch till I reached Vasant Vihar, and then started 		  opening the bike to replace it. All went well, except for 1 bolt 		  which just would not budge. I tried for a couple of hours, then 		  called Royal Beasts Karan, who tried for another hour.

I spent the night at Karan's place, and the next morning, we 		  tried to open the magnet cover again for about 4 hours. Nope, the 		  bolt would not turn a single degree. The groove was long gone, and 		  we'd cut three more grooves through, each of which had slipped and 		  gone.

By the afternoon, we just gave up, and decided to head to the 		  station and load the bike. We had a nice reunion at the station 		  with Sam, Adrian and Arun, who also loaded their bikes with me. We 		  spent the night at a hotel near the airport.

Party right through the next day, till it was time for the 		  flight in the evening. I'll never tire of saying this: Kingfisher 		  Airlines rocks. We even had a comedian Bihari pilot. &quot;Thees ees 		  Captain Misra. Belcome aboard Kingpisser Airlines&quot;.

We had a large reception committee at the Bangalore Airport. 		  Full RTMC-style riot happened, and we headed to our usual 		  Indiranagar adda, the Beer Joint Pub (BJP to familiars). It was 		  great to be back in Bangalore.

Finis. The end. Yippity yappity yeppity That's all, folks!
