Georgia Totto O'Keeffe was an American modernist artist. She was known for her
paintings of enlarged flowers, New York skyscrapers, and New Mexico landscapes.
O'Keeffe has been called the "Mother of American modernism".

Georgia O’Keeffe’s reputation rests in part on the idea that many of her
paintings evoke a certain part of the female anatomy. O'Keeffe herself angrily
rejected the notion that her compositions—especially her floral studies—were
symbolic representations of vaginas, but the idea has stuck. Nevertheless,
there so much more to the artist’s work, which could be described as a blend of
symbolism, precisionism and abstraction.

_Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue_ depicts a cow skull centered in front of
what appears to be a cloth background. In the center of the background is a
vertical black stripe. On either side of that are two vertical stripes of white
laced with blue. At the outside of the painting are two vertical red stripes. 

To O'Keeffe, the bone represented the strength within the America soul, which
is further insinuated by the background colors of red, white, and blue. 

At the time this artwork was made numerous American artists in different fields
were creating compositions dependent on American subjects. Rather than speak to
the pervasive thoughts of America at the time, O'Keeffe portrays a bovine skull
at the focal point of the canvas with the three shades of the American banner
behind it. This image has since become a quintessential symbol of the American
West.
