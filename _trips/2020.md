- 19th of August
- _Birthi - Kala Muni - Birthi - Kwiti - Birthi_
- 62km


Now, the village of Birthi was really spectacularly beautiful.             Though it was barely visible in the dim twilight the previous             evening, the morning show really wowed us. As usual, KMVN has             picked a perfect spot for a tourist guest house. It overlooks a             massive valley, surrounded on all sides by very tall peaks. From             the porch of the guest house, we could count 12 (that's twelve)             water falls in the hills all around.

Birthi is roughly what I would imagine heaven to look like.             Apparently, Sandy and Prashi thought so too, and we decided to             spend an extra day there. This would give sandy to recover from             his falls of the day before, and also time to figure out exactly             what was wrong with his bike. So while Sandy rested, Prashi and             I decided to ride up to Munsiyari and back.

The largest of the waterfalls was right in our backyard. A             bridge built right next to the waterfall even allowed us to             bathe in the spray. None of us was brave enough to venture to             the bridge, though.

While we were clicking away outside the guest house, a couple             of girls walked into the guest house. Prashi stepped in, and             came back out in a hurry! He called to Sandy and I to come in,             the evil bastard. The day, 19th, turned out to be Raksha             Bandhan. The girls were cousins of the caretaker, and in their             enthusiasm, tied one each to Prashi too. Not wanting to rest             alone with his misfortune, Prashi had called us in to get a             couple each ourselves.

Sandy suddenly mentioned that we, as brothers, should gift             something to the girls. Since we had nothing else, we gave them             money. Sandy gave them 50 each, and since I had only 100's, gave             them 100 each. The scared girls were afraid to take it             initially, but then took it after the caretaker reassured them.             The next thing we know, there's a line of some 7-8 girls             outside. _Run !!! Hide !!!_
