- 17th of August
- _Mukteshwar - Sitla - Kwarab Bridge - Almora - Binsar_
- 65km


Early in the morning, we attempted Chauli Ki Jaali a second             time. We decided not to walk, but instead, take our bikes as far             as they would go. We left the bikes at the gate of a large             house, and walked on from there. The Jaali was still thickly             shrouded, and the view, such was it was, wasn't one. A couple of             pooches stayed with us all the way, from the KMVN to the Jaali             and back. Fruitless again, but maybe not for Sandy &quot;MGR&quot; Menon.

On the way back, a very pretty twenty-something girl stepped             out of the house, and asked for some of the spare petrol that my             RD350 always moved around with. Chivalrous sons-of-Raleigh that             we are, we obliged, and were treated to some tea, biscuits,             chips and half-an-hour of her company. Prashi and I feasted on 			the former, while Sandy took full advantage of the latter.

Remember this dialogue from the movie Ghost-busters ?

|:---|:---|
| _Dr. Peter Venkman:_ | This city is headed for a disaster of biblical                   proportions. |
| _Mayor:_ | What do you mean, &quot;biblical&quot;? |
| _Dr Ray Stantz:_ |What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real                   wrath-of-God type stuff. Fire and brimstone coming down                   from the skies. Rivers and seas boiling. |
| _Dr. Egon Spengler:_ | Forty years of darkness. Earthquakes, volcanoes... |
| _Winston Zeddemore:_ | The dead rising from the grave. |
| _Dr. Peter Venkman:_ | Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together - mass                   hysteria. |

Well, I dunno about forty years of darkness, earthquakes,             volcanoes and all that jazz, but we did see dogs and cats living             together. The two dogs which accompanied us to the Jaali place             were playing with a tiny kitten. Maybe it's the start of             something, as Dr. Venkman claims, of biblical proportions!
