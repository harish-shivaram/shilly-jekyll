God moves in a mysterious way  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonders to perform;   
He plants His footsteps in the sea,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rides upon the storm.  

Deep in unfathomable mines  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of never-failing skill,   
He treasures up His bright designs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And works His sovereign will.  

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds ye so much dread   
Are big with mercy, and shall break  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessings on your head.  

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But trust Him for His grace;   
Behind a frowning providence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hides a smiling face.  

His purposes will ripen fast,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfolding every hour;   
The bud may have a bitter taste,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But sweet will be the flower.  

Blind unbelief is sure to err,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And scan His work in vain:   
God is His own interpreter,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he will make it plain.
