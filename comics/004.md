excerpt: The definitive authority on Indian history and mythology

For most Indian children, this is the authoritative bible on all things related to history and mythology. All the numerous luminaries in Indian history, both significant and minor have an album in their name. All stories of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh mythology have an issue. I even have an issue describing the mythological back story behind every sculpture in a specific temple.

Amar Chitra Katha has done an immense service to popularize Indianness and inject pride in our collective history and culture. Their full colour issues and striking artwork has become the definitive authority on the look of historical and mythological characters. 

On the flip side, the stories are largely sanitized. They often omit the more questionable traits and characteristics of their protagonists, and entirely leave out even tangential references to sex, which are actually rampant in mythology.

I should also mention Tinkle, a spin-off children's magazine / comic, which started off in the 80's and is still going strong. It has its own set of recurring characters, and comprises short stories, informational articles as well as 1-4 page humourous short comic strips. Characters like Shikari Shambu, Suppandi, Tantri the Mantri and Kalia the crow tend to stick for their quirky quality.
