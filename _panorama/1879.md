I arise from dreams of thee  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first sweet sleep of night,  
When the winds are breathing low,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars are shining bright  
I arise from dreams of thee,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a spirit in my feet  
Hath led me &mdash; who knows how? &mdash;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thy chamber window, Sweet!  

The wandering airs they faint  
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dark, the silent stream &mdash;  
The champak odors fail  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sweet thoughts in a dream;  
The nightingale's complaint,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;It dies upon her heart;  
As I must on thine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, beloved as thou art!  

O lift me from the grass!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;I die! I faint! I fail!  
Let thy love in kisses rain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;On my lips and eyelids pale.  
My cheek is cold and white, alas!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart beats loud and fast;&mdash;  
Oh! press it to thine own again,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it will break at last.
