>  The new library everybody keeps talking about. 		  For once, a building in Pilani that is not that drab ivory yellow 		  colour. I rarely went to the library even back then, not about to 		  do it on a vacation, now. _Change: Very good_

>  These sign boards dot the campus, at every 		  junction. Dunno who finds it useful. Students know their way around 		  even before the freshers period is over. Profs have all been there 		  forever anyway. _Change: Good_

>  Nagar redi, my breakfast, lunch and dinner. 		  Nagar-ji remembered me, but had forgotten my room numbers though. 		  Been here 50 years, he has. _Change: None, and thats good_

>  The honours board. Parikh is there, wonder why 		  Aman isn't. Those three horror stories from my EEE class are all 		  there, though - Mala Prasanna, Ashish Shah and Apoorva Karan. Wonder 		  if they have a Dishonours board somewhere, my name would have been 		  on that :) _Change: Good_
