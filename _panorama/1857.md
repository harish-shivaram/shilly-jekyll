Down thy valleys, Ireland, Ireland,  
Down thy valleys green and sad,  
Still thy spirit wanders wailing,  
Wanders wailing, wanders mad.  

Long ago that anguish took thee,  
Ireland, Ireland, green and fair,  
Spoilers strong in darkness took thee,  
Broke thy heart and left thee there.  

Down thy valleys, Ireland, Ireland,  
Still thy spirit wanders mad;  
All too late they love that wronged thee,  
Ireland, Ireland, green and sad.
