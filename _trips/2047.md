> The fountains mingle with the river,  
> And the rivers with the ocean;  
> The winds of heaven mix for ever  
> With a sweet emotion;  
> Nothing in the world is single;  
> All things, by a law divine,  
> In one spirit meet and mingle.  
> Why not I with thine?  
> 
> --- P. B. Shelley, &quot;Love's Philosophy&quot;
