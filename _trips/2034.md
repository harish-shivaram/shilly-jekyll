- 25th of August
- _Chopta - Ukhimath - Kund - Tilwara - Rudraprayag -               Srinagar - Devaprayag - Rishikesh_
- 220km


Chopta is a really small and beautiful village. About a 3.5km             trek away is a temple called Tungnath. In good weather, it would             be possible to see all the Char Dham (four holy abodes) -             Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangothri and Yamunothri, from Tungnath.             But this particular morning, Chopta was shrouded in thick fog,             and we couldn't see our hands in front of our faces, let alone             the Char Dham. Needless to say, we were still recovering from             our trek a couple of days back, and Tungnath was out of the             question.

After a leisurely morning, replete with bath, breakfast, and             lazing around, we hit the road at 10:30 or so. We moved about             10m and stopped again... Sandy's rear tyre was flat. An hour,             lots of grunts, groans and curses later, we'd managed to replace             and re-inflate the tube.

Luckily for us, the road was great. At Kund, we joined the             national highway which leads to Gaurikund. Though the traffic             was rather higher here, the road was excellent, and we kept             really good speeds. It was around here that my bike had its             first issue. My right cylinder was misfiring. On opening the             plug, we saw that it was coated thick with carbon. Damn these             fancy imported NGK plugs. I replaced it with a good old MICO,             and we were off.

Throughout the day, we always had a deep valley with a large             river on one side of the road. To start with, it was the             Mandakini, which was assimilated by the Alakananda at             Rudraprayag. Alakananda, in turn, joins with Bhagirathi and is             assimilated into the Ganga at Devaprayag.

We reached Rishikesh-on-Ganga well ahead of schedule, and             spent a good 2 hours of the evening in a hunt for booze, till we             found out that Rishikesh is a dry town.
