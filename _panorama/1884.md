Dawn fires the surface into gold,  
Gold-eyed the herons stilt and stalk.  
At silver noon the waters hold  
Wheelings of a mirrored hawk.  

I've not seen water lie so still  
As here. Perhaps an otter may  
Disturb its peace, or white-cranes till  
The green edge, wading tall-knee-deep.  

In gusts of wind, a faint wood hum&mdash;  
Plucked leaves and broken petals dance,  
The wind departs, the wood is dumb,  
And floating yellows gather brown.  

To think up to a mile ago  
This river bounded like a hound,  
Convulsed and nearly wrecked our boat,  
And lies here gentle as a pond !  

A rich practical man I'm told  
Demanded, why this idleness?  
He got no answer and compelled  
The river into harness.  

Like frightened birds the minutes fled  
Pursued by roaring steel and fire.  
The river slaved and profits grew  
To almost overtake desire.  

Until, they say, one windy night,  
In deepest vigils of the owl,  
The river rose and foaming white  
Descended like a murderer.  

At dawn the waters shone restored  
The wreckage stood like blasted rocks  
Round which the burnished mirror showed  
Artistry of a wild brown hawk.
