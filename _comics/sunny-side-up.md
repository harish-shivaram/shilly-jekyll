Sunny is spending the summer with her grandfather who lives in a retirement village down in florida.  It's full of... old people. Really old people. And grandpa's idea of an adventure is going to pick up his pills.

Luckily, Sunny isn't the only kid around. She meets Buzz, a boy who is completely obsessed with comic books, and soon they're having adventures of their own, facing off against golfball-eating alligators, runaway cats, and mysteriously disappearing neighbors. 

The real question, though, is why Sunny is in Florida at all. The story is slowly divulged through a series of flashbacks, as the reader pieces together that her brother is in rehab, and she has been sent over to the Pine Palms retirement community to keep her out of the way, so to speak.

The book has lovely and captivating full-color drawings that capture the era and the characters to perfection. A good read.
