She walks in beauty like the night  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cloudless climes and starry skies,  
And all that's best of dark and bright  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet in her aspect and her eyes;  
Thus mellowed to the tender light  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which heaven to gaudy day denies.  

One ray the more, one shade the less  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had half impaired the nameless grace  
Which waves in every raven tress  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or softly lightens o'er her face,  
Where thoughts serenely sweet express  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How pure, how dear their dwelling place.  

And on that cheek and o'er that brow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So soft, so calm yet eloquent,  
The smiles that win, the tints that glow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But tell of days in goodness spent  
A mind at peace with all below,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heart whose love is innocent.<br />
