This series created by Lee Falk told the story of a shadowy masked figure deep in the African jungle, who maintains law and order. He was arguably the first masked crusader who did not have any special powers, but handled himself largely by using his wits and athleticism. It predates Batman by several years.

The origin story is fascinating. 400 years ago, a man is marooned by pirates on the African coast, and vows to protect the downtrodden and dedicates his life, and those of his descendants the cause. Their headquarters are a skull shaped castle, and is called to action by messages conveyed by beating drums. He roms through the jungle with his white horse Hero, and his pet wolf Devil. He uses a pair of automatic pistols he wears in hip holsters, but generally uses the guns only to disarm or disable opponents. He wears a signet ring, with which he marks the bad guys, and leaves an indelible skull mark on them.

The artwork was excellent, but the writing was truly outstanding. The enigma of the Phantom, the ghost who walks, is built up using small aphorisms, marked "Old Jungle Saying".

The phantom is immortal. The character, and the comic, both.
