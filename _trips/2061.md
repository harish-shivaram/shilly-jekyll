>  I never really understood the geography here in             Nubra. Take this picture for example. There's arid brush, desert             sand, meadows, a forest, and finally mountains... snow capped at             that. And though it's not visible, there's a river flowing             through the forest too.

>  Hmmm...... 

We reached Hunder in the afternoon, and decided to take a             couple of rooms at a Samba guest house. Now, this place had 3             rooms, and one was already occupied. Small world, small world!             The one occupant was a Bangalorean, Sunder, an amateur             photographer and biker, who was spending a good few weeks in             Ladakh trying to capture it all with his lens.

We had a nice long evening with drinks and dinner, and we were             also joined by a German old-model who had come to Hunder,             trekking from Leh. We kept it up until it was too dark to see,             and too cold to eat/drink.
