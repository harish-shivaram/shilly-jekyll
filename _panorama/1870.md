My days among the Dead are past;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around me I behold,  
Where'er these casual eyes are cast,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mighty minds of old:  
My never-failing friends are they,  
With whom I converse day by day.  
&nbsp;  
With them I take delight in weal  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek relief in woe;  
And while I understand and feel  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much to them I owe,  
My cheeks have often been bedew'd  
With tears of thoughtful gratitude.  
&nbsp;  
My thoughts are with the Dead; with them  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in long-past years,  
Their virtues love, their faults condemn,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partake their hopes and fears,  
And from their lessons seek and find  
Instruction with an humble mind.  
&nbsp;  
My hopes are with the Dead; anon  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My place with them will be,  
And I with them shall travel on  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all Futurity;  
Yet leaving here a name, I trust,  
That will not perish in the dust.
