- 22th of August
- _Joshimath - Govindghat - Ghangria_
- 40km


The road from Joshimath to Govindghat is one way, and changes             direction every three hours or so. It first opens at 6:30 AM,             and closes shortly after that. So on the dot, 6:30 AM, we hit             the road. We had already checked out, and taken a minimum of             luggage, no spares and no gear (well, except our helmets).

I guess we really were early birds, cause the road was             practically empty... if it can be called a road at all. Bad is             not the word. It was barely more than a dirt track, as frequent             landslides had removed all semblance of tarmac. We actually had             to ride through a stretch where a landslide was... well... land             was sliding. We had to swerve to avoid becoming road kill.             _Rolling Stones_ don't gather moss, but can easily gather             bikers, as we learnt the hard way.

>  Prashi slides on land. Unfortunate choice of             words ? I don't think so. 

26km from Joshimath is Govindghat. From Govindghat is a 14km             trek to Ghangria. At Ghangria is a fork in the road, the left             going to the Valley of Flowers and the right to a place called             Hemkund Sahib. Hemkund is a very holy Gurdwara which is open for             4 months in a year - July to October. During these months, huge             numbers of Sikhs do a pilgrimage to this place. Ever heard of             the madding crowd ? We got to see it. It seemed like half of             Punjab was there, turbans, sarson-da-saag and all. All sign             boards are written in Gurmukhi, and everybody sported a kirpan.

We found a parking place for the bikes and got onto the route             to Ghangria. There are 2 ways to do the 14km trek from             Govindghat to Ghangria - Foot and Horseback. I chose the former,             but Prashi and Sandy decided to play &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot;.

>  This town ain't big enough for the two of us...             yaw dirrrty dawg 

We are in Garhwal now, and the guest houses are called GMVN             (Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam) as opposed to KMVN. We continued             our patronage of them to Ghangria. 4 and a half hours later, I             trudge into Ghangria, well near the other tip of India from             Udupi, I find Prashi and Sandy stuffing their faces with...             Masala Dosas. Though not great, they were a very welcome break             from our usual Aloo Parathas.

All of us were completely tired from the trip up, including             our intrepid horsemen. To quote Sandy, &quot;_The horse took my             ass_&quot;. The rest of the day, we just slept, or walked around             among the crowds of Sikhs and foreigners who populated Ghangria             almost exclusively.
