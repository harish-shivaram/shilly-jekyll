East of West takes place in the 2060's, in an alternate America, where the American Civil War lasted significantly longer and was much bloodier. It ended only when a comet struck right at the center of America, which finally brought all the warring parties to a negotiating table, to sign an Armistice. But the brutal war and irreconcilable differences have split America into seven nations:
- The Union,
- The Confederacy,
- Republic of Texas,
- Kingdom of New Orleans,
- Endless Nation,
- People's Republic of America, and
- Armistice, where the comet struck.

The uneasy truce holds, but soon after, three leaders make a prophecy shortly before they die, the exact same prophecy predicting the end of times. This prophecy, dubbed "The Message", becomes the guiding gospel for a group called the Chosen, a collection of significant people from each of the seven nations, who have been put together by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, with the intention of hastening the upcoming end of times.

And that is the premise, the backstory that is laid out before the very first issue starts the story.

The story starts with Death, the fourth horseman, on a quest for vengeance. He was betrayed and his family was killed by the other three horsemen, for the "crime" of having fallen in love with a mortal human, and worse, having a child. Now, he is working his way back to the other horsemen and the Chosen, in classic Western-hero fashion, for his revenge.

But as we later learn, his wife and child are still alive; his wife held prisoner by her own family, and his son has been raised by the Chosen in a virtual reality, trained from birth to one-day become the Beast of the Apocalypse.

Within this overarching plot-line are several other plot-lines involving the scheming, conniving, back-stabbing and manoeuvring of the Chosen, and indeed, their adversaries. And there are some Machiavellian characters whose agenda remain a mystery to all. There are entire volumes filled with complex political intrigue. Given the large cast of characters, it is a challenge to keep track of the affliations (if any) of each one. Often some obscure minor angle from twenty issues ago will suddenly become central to the plot. Quite some investment from the reader is needed to track every such angle.

The artwork is absolutely stunning, and the landscapes and other-worldly creatures are a treat to look at. Some things worth noting are the sci-fi elements; the flying trains, robot dogs and horses, the gigantic war machines are all absolutely magnificent. The fantasy elements are just as imposing; the demons are all teeth and raw flesh, the stuff nightmares would be scared of.

It is hard to recommend this series, and equally hard not to, and often for the same reasons. But if nothing else, read it for the splendid artwork.
