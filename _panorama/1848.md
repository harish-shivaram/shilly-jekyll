poem: true
author: Byron, Lord George Gordon Noel

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see before me the Gladiator lie:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He leans upon his hand -- his manly brow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consents to death, but conquers agony,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his droop'd head sinks gradually low --  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arena swims around him -- he is gone,  
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard it, but he heeded not -- his eyes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were with his heart, and that was far away;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reck'd not of the life he lost nor prize,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There where his young barbarians all at play,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was their Dacian mother -- he, their sire,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Butcher'd to make a Roman holiday --  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this rush'd with his blood -- Shall he expire  
And unavenged? Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!
