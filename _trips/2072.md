>  The valley below the Gata loops! The view is so             spectacularly beautiful and distracting, we're in danger of             going off the road on the twisties.

>  Another view of the valley. The river is the             Beas river, a tributary of the Indus.

>  From the bottom-most loop. 

A short while after the loops, we reached the camp-town of             Sarchu. Our original plan was to camp here for the night, but it             was still early in the afternoon, so we decided to push on to             Bharatpur. But 10km out of Sarchu, we meet the RTMC boys Adrian,             Sam and Arun, on their way up to Leh. Talk about wild reunions!

A short distance from the meeting point was an approriately             named &quot;Poppy Tent Camp&quot;. Pretty expensive place, but ideal for a             party :- It had two-man luxury tents and a nice large central             tent which was a dining hall, prayer room and party venue all             rolled into one. We got very high that evening... and I'm not             just talking of the 13500 ft above sea level.
