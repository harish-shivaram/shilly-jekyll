Van Gogh was probably the greatest Dutch artist after
[Rembrandt](/art/rembrandt). He was a bitterly unhappy and lonely man, and we
know a good deal about his inner life as a result of a massive, stirring and
deeply moving autobiography in the form of hundreds of letters written to his
brother Theo. These described how his paintings and drawings attempted to give
shape to his feelings; they were cries of anguish in his passionate and
ultimately destructive search for self-knowledge.

He was a man of deep religious belief, the son of a minister, and he was both
lay preacher and missionary in a coal-mining district of Belgium before he took
up painting. His character is full of contradictions: his dedication has
resulted in a large number of magnificent and important paintings and drawings;
yet he also abandoned himself to drink, despair, and the violent expression of
his personal feelings. He mutilated himself by cutting off his ear, and finally
committed suicide.

Most of his short life was spent in Holland, and his paintings of Dutch
peasants are characterized by heavy dark colour; but in 1886 he joined his
brother Theo in Paris, where he was influenced by the Impressionists and his
entire colour range broadened and lightened. In 1888 he moved to Arles in the
South of France, and his work became increasingly vivid and passionate as his
mental state deteriorated. He suffered from fits, and was eventually admitted
to an asylum at Saint-Remy. He was allowed freedom to paint, however, and in
his clear periods was still productive, but it was there in 1890 that he
eventually shot himself.

In _Starry Night_ it is easy to see the turbulence of his unbalanced and
tormented personality behind the vibrant colour and fast and furious brushwork,
with its characteristic short strokes and swirls of paint. But the painting has
too the energy and vigour which were an essential part of van Gogh’s
temperament and art.

It is full of a sense of joy and understanding of the relationship between the
world we know on earth and the vast expanses of the universe. The cypresses,
familiar features in his landscapes, tower against the deep blue of the night
sky, with its sun and crescent moon and eleven stars whirling in space. There
are lights in all the village houses, and a church at the centre whose central
spire reaches up to the sky above the distant hills. The eleven stars are other
worlds continuing into infinity and dwarfing our own planet, yet the village
lights and the church link the earth with them, emphasizing that it is part of
the same immense creation. It is an intensely religious picture, painted with
an almost fanatical fervour, and its strength and energy are electrifying.

Van Gogh's desire to paint a starry night sky was something he mentioned
repeatedly in his letters throughout 1888. The result was this study of Arles,
as he described it to Eugene Boch: "The town lighted with gas reflected in a
blue river. Over it the starry sky with the Great Bear &mdash; a sparkling of
pink and green on the cobalt blue field of the night sky, whereas the lights of
the town and its ruthless reflections are in red gold and bronzed green'.

Van Gogh's own "white deal chair", painted as a pendant (companion piece) to
Gauguin's armchair. Both chairs were symbolic portraits of the two young men,
painted in a rare period of calm, shortly after [Gauguin](/art/gauguin)'s
arrival at the Yellow House in Arles.
