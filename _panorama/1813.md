Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,  
&nbsp; Old Time is still a-flying;  
And this same flower that smiles today  
&nbsp; Tomorrow will be dying.  

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,   
&nbsp; The higher he’s a-getting,  
The sooner will his race be run,  
&nbsp; And nearer he’s to setting.  

That age is best which is the first,  
&nbsp; When youth and blood are warmer;  
But being spent, the worse, and worst  
&nbsp; Times still succeed the former.   

Then be not coy, but use your time,  
&nbsp; And while ye may, go marry;  
For having lost but once your prime,  
&nbsp; You may forever tarry.
