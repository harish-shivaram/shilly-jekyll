A group of teenaged boys are thrust into a large open area called the glade. None of them have any memories, other than their names. In the daytime, the Glade is a beautiful garden. But beyond the stone walls is an ever changing maze. The boys explore the maze in the daytime, but at night, the maze is closed off, and full of mechanical monsters which can slice and sting. Through the maze is the only way out, but no one has ever made it through alive.

The boys set up a community in the Glade, with different groups performing different functions. Each group has their own hierarchy and everyone talks Glade-speak, a slang that has evolved right there on the Glade.

The story starts when Thomas arrives at the Glade, and integrates into its society. Then everything changes when a girl arrives, with an ominous message.

One thing that is a common theme among young adult fiction is the complete lack of personality the characters seem to have. It's one thing to not have any memories; but they seem to have no thoughts, no opinions, no feelings and no enterprise. They act only on instinct, with no perception of consequences or foresight.

If this is the kind of book that is popular among the "young" adults... I fear for that generation.
