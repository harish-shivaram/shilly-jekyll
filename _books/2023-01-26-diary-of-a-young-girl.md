The Diary of a Young Girl, also known as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the Dutch language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.

The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.

The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the war was over. The diary has since been published in more than 60 languages

I don't believe we are qualified to review this book... this diary. The wonderful chronicle of the time spent by the Frank family and friends in hiding at the Annex; a secret set of rooms behind a cupboard in an office building. The original Dutch title of the book is simply "Het Achterhuis"... (The Annex). By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account is a fascinating portrait of human courage and frailty.

Anne's dearest dream was to be come an author; with the book translated into 60 languages and having published millions, we can safely say she remains one of the most prolific authors of all time.
