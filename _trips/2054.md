>  Another monastery with a nice garden and all.             Sometimes it seems that these monasteries are the only signs of             civilisation.

>  The magnetic hill! Apparently the a vehicle             parked, in neutral, in the box is not supposed to roll off. I             tried thrice, it didn't work for me.

We ran into this pair for the first time at Nimmu, 35km from             Leh. They have been cycling all the way from Srinagar. No backup             truck, no supplies jeep. They operate just like us... except             they use bicycles. Incredible!

>  And finally, Leh! 

We didn't quite get into Leh right away, when we reached. A             bit of refuelling in the outskirts of Leh, and we headed to             Choglamsar, 15km ahead of Leh. We stayed in a nice resort-type             hotel, on the banks of the Indus. Right next door was the most             important monastery in the Ladakh region. A quick wash and we             headed back to Leh for dinner.

We ran into our cyclist friends again, on the market street in             Leh. The two are a very interesting pair. Bong (Abhijit Barman)             is a professional outdoor guy, and has bicycled through most of             South and South East Asia. Kedar (Kedari Gupta) is a             professional driver who is into cycling in a big way, both             touring and racing.
