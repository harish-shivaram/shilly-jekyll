Caravaggio was a stormy and excitable man, and his tempestuous life was
surrounded by controversy. He stabbed a man to death after a violent quarrel in
Rome, was imprisoned, but escaped and fled to Sicily. From there he was pursued
to Naples and nearly murdered in a brawl with a group of cut-throat
mercenaries.

The vivid and sensational quality of his temperament is reflected in his art.
People were shocked by his work, but it was widely admired and extremely
influential.  When he died at the age of thirty-seven he was generally
recognized as one of the most exciting painters and innovators of the Baroque
age.

In particular his use of chiaroscuro (strong light contrasted with deep shadow)
and dramatic foreshortening are the characteristics of his work for which he is
best known. His technical methods were unusual for the sixteenth century: he
painted directly on to canvas instead of working from sketches and squared-up
drawings in the accepted fashion, and this gave his style a remarkable zest.

Bacchus was the god of wine and fertility, and he was a common subject in
paintings of the period. This portrayal of him, executed when Caravaggio was
barely twenty years old, may well be a self-portrait; and the young god in his
crown of grapes and vine leaves certainly has some of the artistâ€™s passion and
vitality in his gaze. Although his pose is indolent and relaxed he has an air
of repressed energy.

His foreshortened arm is thrust forward so that it breaks the flat surface of
the painting and draws us in towards him. It is a powerful pose, and its
directness is very arresting. A strong light silhouettes his figure against the
dark background, and this chiaroscuro device heightens the effect of his
gesture. The bowl of fruit and carafe of wine underline his sensuality and the
mood of indulgence. Bacchus is a superb example of the effects of lighting,
foreshortening and vivid realism achieved by Caravaggio.
