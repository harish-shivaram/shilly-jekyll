When I consider how my light is spent  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that one talent which is death to hide  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent  
&nbsp;To serve therewith my Maker, and present  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My true account, lest he returning chide,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?&quot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent  
&nbsp;That murmur, soon replies: &quot;God doth not need  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Either man's work or his own gifts: who best  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state  
Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And post o'er land and ocean without rest:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also serve who only stand and wait.&quot;
