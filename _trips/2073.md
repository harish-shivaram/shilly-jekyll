The three boys coming up bore foul tidings from the plains. A             bridge near Khoksar was collapsing, and the BRO were not             allowing anybody across untill the bridge was rebuilt. The boys             were among the last to be allowed before they started             dismantling the bridge. It was quite unlikely that we would be             allowed across. The trouble was, this bridge is the only way             across to Manali.

Early morning at Poppy Tent Camp, before we each went our ways.             

Morning, we continued our descended towards Manali, and beyond             to New Delhi, as the three boys ascended towards Leh and the             skies. The road detiorated drastically a short distance from             Sarchu, and by the time we were in Bharatpur, even the few             traces of tarmac around the potholes disappeared.

>  First signs that we were approaching the             plains... farms on the valley slopes. 

By lunch-time, we were at Keylong. The bridge was now fully             dismantled, and depending on who we spoke to, it would take             anywhere between three days and a couple of weeks to rebuild it.             We rode on to Tandi to fill up, after we dumped the luggage at a             hotel in Keylong. It was futile to ride up to Khoksar, since             everybody was sure that there was no way we'd be able to ride             across.

We had a nice evening in Keylong with a substantial Tibetian             dinner. A couple of other foreigner biker groups (Swedish, I             think they were) were also stranded like us, and we had a nice             time at dinner swapping stories of rides.
