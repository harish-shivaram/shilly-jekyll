Utagawa Hiroshige was a leading exponent of _ukiyo-e_ - 'Pictures of the floating
world' during the last half century of its existence as a Japaense art form.
Ukiyo-e originated in the late seventeenth century, dedicated to the pursuit
of pleasure in everyday urban life and based on popular idols taken from the
ranks of courtesans and actors.

The collectable ukiyo-e woodblock prints developed along relatively
sophisticated lines of their own, within the Japanese tradition of harmonious
colour and graceful composition, which raised them above plain folk art. They
were priced to suit the pockets of middle-class tradesmen, artisans and
merchants. Paintings were reserved for the wealthier ranks.

Hiroshige's total output was immense, some 5400 prints. He studied drawing
from childhood and was apprenticed to just one master, Utagawa Tohoyiro. Yet
Hiroshige worked for over twenty years before producing the series that
established his reputation, _Fifty-three stations of the Tokaido Road_; an
ambitious travelogue that followed the great highway between Kyoto and Edo.

**Night Snow at Kanbara** is a wood-block print from the series _Fifty-three
stations of the Tokaido Road_. His characteristically shaded sky registers
twilight over a mountain village engulfed in snow, through which three people
are struggling home. Snow, rain or mist are favoured background conditions
against which Hiroshige sets his travellers, often depicted crossing each
others' paths, emphasizing the transcience of existence.

Working in the nineteenth century, Hiroshige and Hokusai each preferred to
creates landscapes rather than portraits of actors, wrestlers, poets and
courtesans. Their innate love of the Japanese for all aspects of the natural
world ensured that both artists had an enthusiastic following. Although he may
not have matched Hokusai's draftsmanship, Hiroshige at his best is unsurpassed
in his poetic vision. His ability to evoke the mood of a particular place
still has unfailing appeal to westerners.
