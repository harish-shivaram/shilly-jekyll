Just after the above snap was taken, my bike gave its only             major problem throughout the entire trip. When I started the             bike, I noticed a substantial difference in the exhaust note.             Leakage, from the manifold clamp. I assumed that my silencer             gasket had blown, since there was also a considerable amount of             oil leakage from around the clamp.

The others had all gone ahead, and I needed to catch up with             them, as Prashi is the expert on these things. I was a little             scared to start the bike, and since it was all downhill to Pang,             I just rolled down in neutral, with the engine off. A very             stupid thing to do, but 23 hair-pin bends later, I got down to             the Pang military camp all right.

We discovered that the problem was much worse than I'd             thought. The left bend pipe neck was cut! It had started because             the thread had worn out on the holding bolt of the silencer.             This caused it to become loose and induce a lot of vibration in             the silencer and bend pipe. After much panic, argument, flaring             tempers, etc., we managed to jam the neck in hard enough to             hold. Ideally, it should have been welded, but hey...

It seemed like my problem was gone away, but it would come             back to haunt me later. And like how...
