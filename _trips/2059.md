>  The actual Nubra valley. The river seen here is             the Shyok. Further up the road is the point where the Nubra             river joins the Shyok river. All these rivers flow into the             Indus, eventually.

>  There are may such small villages in the valley             along the Nubra/Shyok rivers. Usually a small track leads down             to them off the main road we were on.

>  The first bit of desert we saw. The Nubra valley             is home to the highest cold desert in the world.
