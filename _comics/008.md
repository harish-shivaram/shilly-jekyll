Powerfully lean and mean - just like the warriors of the title - this epic graphic novel is hyper-violent but also ruggedly stylish. Leonides and his trusted Spartan battalion are all that stand in the way of the waves of military forces invading the enlightened ancient nation of Greece. 

The book is full of extreme warfare scenes, with literal mountains of body parts, along with terse but well-written dialogue - a tour-de-force from the talented Mr. Miller.

This was adapted almost exactly into the seminal movie of the same name; the movie dierctor almost used the comic as a story board for the scenes of the movie. Which is exactly how a work of perfection should be treated. The scenes from the movie (and by extension, the book) are now stuff of legend.
