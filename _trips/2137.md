> We woke that morning in a Munnar entirely enveloped in thick fog.

A nice Mallu breakfast and we were off to see the local sights. Still drizzling from the previous day, we headed for Top Station, reputed to be one of the best view points around those parts.

> En route, we passed through acres of tea gardens and reached a nearly dry Mattupetty dam.

> View from the centre of the dam. This should make a nice wallpaper. They ought to put photographs like this one in the travel brochure.
