>  Sunrise, at Rangdum 

Prashi and Chaithra were in terrible physical shape that             morning. Prashi threw up everything he ate, while Chaithra just             didn't eat anything at all. I bought a few packets of biscuits             at the shop. Very interesting brands: _Pearl-G_ and             _50-40_. Both manufactured by a _Tasty Biscuits Pvt.             Ltd._ with an address in Ludhiana. Frankly, the biscuits             weren't half bad... or maybe it was just my Maggi aversion that             made me feel that way.

Nothing much occurred on this day either. More _hard_             riding, as we retraced our route back to Kargil. We stopped at             the same village for lunch. We had had our fill of Maggi, so we             opted for cornflakes this time. Odd looks all around!             Apparently, only Israelites eat cornflakes. Huh!?!

The bikes didn't quite survive the abuse of the last two days:

- Prashi's carrier literally fell apart, and except for his               saddle bags, all his luggage was moved to my bike.
- Ranga's sidestand spring flew off, and was tied up with a               handkerchief for the rest of the ride.
- My suspension, which was absolute top order until now, was               screaming under the overload.


Still, we were safely back in Kargil, Hotel Greenland.
