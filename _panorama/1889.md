Three happy children in a darkened room!  
What do they gaze on with wide-open eyes?  

A dense, dense forest, where no sunbeam pries,  
And in its centre a cleared spot.—There bloom  
Gigantic flowers on creepers that embrace  
Tall trees; there, in a quiet lucid lake  
The while swans glide; there, "whirring from the brake,  
The peacock springs; there, herds of wild deer race;  
There, patches gleam with yellow waving grain;  
There, blue smoke from strange altars rises light,  
There, dwells in peace, the poet-anchorite.  
But who is this fair lady? Not in vain  
She weeps.—for lo! at every tear she sheds  
Tears from three pairs of young eyes fall amain,  
And bowed in sorrow are the three young heads.  
It is an old, old story, and the lay  
Which has evoked sad Sîta from the past  
Is by a mother sung... 'Tis hushed at last  
And melts the picture from their sight away,  
Yet shall they dream of it until the day!  
When shall those children by their mother's side  
Gather, ah me! as erst at eventide?
