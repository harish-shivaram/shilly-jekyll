I'm back! My trusty RD350 and I blasted right through the most             unforgettable experience in my life. Rain and sun, sands and             snow, rivers, jungles and some of the highest roads in the             world, we've survived them all. I've posted here the photographs             and a write-up about the ride.

>  My bike, before the ride. I never took an             &quot;after&quot; picture. It was too heartbreaking. Anyway, she's fully             restored now, and looks just like she does above.

<h3>Some numbers</h3>

- _39_: The total days, Bangalore to Bangalore
- _9967_: Meter reading at start
- _16442_: Meter reading at end
- _6475_: Total distance covered, in km
- _385_: Total fuel consumed, in litres.
- _16.8_: Mileage, in km/l. Woohoo!

<h3>Summary</h3>
The first leg of the ride started on the 15th of August, from             New Delhi. Prashanth, Sandy Menon and I rode through             Uttaranchal, and got back to Delhi on the 26th. The second leg             started on the 28th, from New Delhi again. Prashanth, Ranga,             Chaithra and I rode to Srinagar, across Ladakh to Leh and back             to New Delhi. The highlights were the detours into Zanskar             valley and Nubra valley. I rode the last leg alone, from Delhi             through Rajasthan.

<h3>Dedication</h3>
Prashi and I dedicate this ride to the memory of Satyajit             Bhattacharya. May his soul rest in peace.

I filched this website design from <a href="http://fullahead.org">FullAhead.org</a>. Most of the             photographs here are by me. I have used some of Prashi's photos             too, where I've said &quot;Courtesy Prashi&quot;.
