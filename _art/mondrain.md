Piet Mondrain came from a devout Calvinist family of keen painters and
musicians. But their repressive discipline led to his rejection of steady art
teaching career in favour of the artist's life itself, and later still, to his
embrace of Theosophy.

This mystical belief system &mdash; in humanity's evolution towards spiritual
unity &mdash; was popular in the West at that time, not least amongst the
pioneers of abstract art, Kandinsky and Malevich. Mondrain encounter with
Cubism in 1911 was the critical point of his artistic development, when he
removed natural forms from his pictorial vocabulary. Together with Theosophy,
it propelled him into the ranks of the avant-garde. The obscure Dutchman left
for Paris, the first step towards an international life that would have a
lasting impact on western art.

Stranded in Holland by World War I, Mondrain and Theo van Doesburg formed a
group and published a magazine called _De Stijl_ (The Style). The writer
Schoenmaeker's ideas of 'positive mysticism' we directly incorporated and
Mondrain's aesthetic became their guiding force, committed to purifying modern
art and bringing it to everyone via architecture, product design and
typography.

The very term, Neo-Plasticism, that Mondrain adopted for his geometric
abstractions in 1921, was borrowed from Schoenmaeker. With his typical
asymmetrical arrangements of squares and rectangles painted in primary colours
divided by black bands on a white ground, Mondrain strove for transcendental
experience and pure harmony.

Mondrain kept strictly to vertical and horizontal lines of composition and broke
with Van Doesburg for introducing diagonals into his work in 1924. When
Mondrain moved to New York, in response to his energetic new surroundings, his
lines formed the all-colour grids which came to be called "Boogie Woogie"
