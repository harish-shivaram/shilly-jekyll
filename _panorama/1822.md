HOW happy is he born or taught  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That serveth not another's will,   
Whose armor is his honest thought,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And simple truth his highest skill;  

Whose passions not his masters are;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose soul is still prepared for death,   
Untied unto the world with care  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of princes' grace or vulgar breath;  

Who envies none whom chance doth raise,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or vice; who never understood   
The deepest wounds are given by praise,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By rule of state but not of good;  

Who hath his life from rumours freed,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose conscience is his strong retreat,   
Whose state can neither flatterers feed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ruins make accusers great;  

Who God doth late and early pray  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More of his grace than goods to send,   
And entertains the harmless day  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a well-chosen book or friend.  

This man is free from servile bands  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hope to rise or fear to fall,   
Lord of himself, though not of lands,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And having nothing, yet hath all.
