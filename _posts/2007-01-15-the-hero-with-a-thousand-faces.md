This is a book written by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell in 1949. In this, he postulates that all archetypal-hero mythology, independently evolved in various parts of the world, share a common structure which he calls the monomyth. He explains this as an unconscious force of the mind; the human mind looks up to the same kind of person as a hero.  

His theory states that the monomyth comprises 5 basic parts:  

1. The Hero, a common man, is called to Adventure in a supernatural world, which he accepts reluctantly.
1. He has to face a series of trials and tribulations
1. He achieves victory in his goal, and receives as reward a great power
1. He returns to the ordinary world.
1. He uses his great power for the benefit of his fellow men.

There are a few more aspects of the description of the hero. He has a very close human friend, who remains by his side through all his trials. He has a faithful pet animal who is completely devoted to him. He has some trouble with his father-figure... the nature of this trouble varies, but he always reconciles with the father-figure towards the end. And of course, there is the love interest.


This concept has been re-used in the modern day myths, in our movies, in our books. As an illustration, I shall compare four seminal hero-myths, the Ramayana, Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Matrix. While the first three are all almost fully compliant with the monomyth, Matrix omits certain aspects.  



1. **Hero has trouble with father figure**
    - Rama is exiled by his father, at a step-mother's behest.
    - Luke Skywalker's &quot;Dark Father&quot; is the most evil man in the galaxy, and is hidden from him in Tatooine
    - Harry Potter's father is killed by the most evil wizard.
    - Not applicable, Neo's parents don't feature. 
2. **Hero has very close human friend**
    - Lakshmana
    - Han Solo
    - Ron Weasley
    - Morpheus
3. **Hero has a faithful, supernatural pet animal**
    - Hanuman
    - Chewbacca... well this is a bit confusing. Who's the hero here, Han or Luke ?
    - Hedwig
    - Not applicable in Matrix
4. **Hero has a Love Interest**
    - Sita
    - Leia ... again, who's the hero ? Han or Luke ?
    - Hermione ? Bit confusing again.
    - Trinity
5. **Hero is called to great adventure**
    - Rama's 12 years of exile in the forest</li>
    - Luke and Han called to join the rebellion</li>
    - Potter's Entry to the world of magic</li>
    - Neo takes the red pill.</li>
6. **When the hero starts out, an elderly figure helps him and provides him with tools/weapons**
    - The sage Vishwamithra gives Rama a whole bunch of celestial weapons.  
    - Obi-Wan Ben Kenobi gives him the light sabre and his first lessons as a Jedi
    - Hagrid gives Potter a whole bunch of stuff including, of course, his wand.
    - Morpheus' frees the mind of Neo, and the Oracle tells Neo his fate
7. **Series of trials and tribulations culminating in a final battle with his nemesis.**
    - Rama defeats a dozen or more asuras, culminating with the final battle against Ravana.
    - Luke and Han are involved in a series of skirmishes with Imperial forces, culminating with the final battle against the emperor himself.
    - Potter has a series of fights against Voldemort culminating with the final fight against the Evil Wizard himself (yeah, I know, the book hasn't come out yet).
    - Neo has multiple skirmishes with the agents, culminating in the final battle against the Agent Smith.
8. **He achieves his goal, and receives a great reward.**
    This is a little tough enumerate in all the myths. Yes, all of them defeat their respective nemeses, but the boon in all cases is faith in their own capabilities.   
9. **Return to the ordinary world and initial reluctance to do so.**
    - Rama returns to Ayodhya and resumes his place on the throne. He is reluctant to do so initially, because he wants Bharata to continue being king.
    - The story ends before the return... so I dunno.
    - Story yet to evolve. But I can hazard a guess here... maybe Potter will have return to the world of muggles and live the life of an ordinary human being.
    - Matrix is an exception, because Neo dies in the battle against Smith.  
10. **Reconciliation with the father-figure**
    - Dasaratha is dead before Rama returns, and this sadly doesn't happen. But actually, his reconciliation is with Keikeyi, which does happen pretty early on.
    - Darth Vader becomes good again, he becomes Anakin Skywalker again.
    - Again, James Potter is already dead, I am not sure what the reconciliation would be. (maybe with his uncle and aunt ?). Will have to wait for the book to come out.
    - Not applicable

The following also fall into the monomyth structure, but I am not well-versed enough in any of them to do a comparative analysis.

<ol>
    <li>JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings</li>
    <li>Homer's Illiad &amp; Odyssey</li>
    <li>Heracles (Hercules) in Greek mythology</li>
    <li>Rustam in Persian Mythology</li>
    <li>Cuchulainn in Irish Druid Mythology</li>
</ol>
