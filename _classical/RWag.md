## Biography

![Richard Wagner](/images/classical/14.jpg){:.image .right}
One of the most influential composers of all time, Wagner unquestionably changed the course of both opera and classical music in general.

He developed the concept of what he described as 'total art work', using the mediums of music and drama to convey political, psychological, emotional and ethical issues within the framework of a work of art – his 'music dramas', as he preferred them to be called.

Wagner's works are on a grand scale, usually using a very large orchestra and a huge chorus.

The music is normally continuous, unlike in most other operas, where there are individual arias and choruses, sometimes interspersed with dialogue.

Seeing a Wagner opera is more akin to taking part in an epic movie, and the intensity and dramatic impact of these works is totally absorbing.

He is most famous for his cycle of operas The Ring, four 'music dramas' based on the story of a power struggle between ancient gods, giants, dwarves and humans.

This is strong stuff and can be approached on two levels: either simply as a piece of extraordinary music drama, or as a study of the parallels Wagner was drawing between myth and reality, good and evil, primitive and contemporary society.

It must be left to the listener to judge whether or not Wagner was making political statements within his work and, as you can imagine, this has been the subject of much discussion amongst musicians, opera goers and musicologists for the last hundred years.

A number of recordings exist of the preludes to his operas and these will give you an idea as to the flavour of the music.

For a true picture of the vocal impact that Wagner's music can have, do explore any of the recordings that are available presenting highlights of some of the more popular sections of his works.

Titles to look out for include: Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, Tristan und Isolde, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Parsifal and The Ring.

## The Flying Dutchman

One of Wagner's earlier successes, The Flying Dutchman clearly shows the composer's interest in legend: it tells the supernatural story of a haunted sailor who must forever sail the seas until redeemed by the love of a good woman.

## Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg
**Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg: Prelude**

_1845, Opera_

Die Meistersinger is a comedy opera of love and triumph, where the hero must win a singing contest to win the girl.

## Tannhäuser

_1845, Opera_

Like Die Meistersinger, this opera has a song contest, yet is steeped in heavy religious overtones.

## Here Comes the Bride
**Lohengrin: 'Here Comes the Bride'**

_1853, Opera_

Wagner, always fascinated by legend, set this opera in a land of knights in armour and endless chivalry.

## The Ride of the Valkyries

<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3'><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/P73Z6291Pt8'  allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Taken from 'Die Walküre', the second part of Wagner's masterpiece 'The Ring of the Nibelung', 'The Ride of the Valkyries' is a powerful and rumbustious piece that was used to great effect in the film 'Apocalypse Now'.

## Siegfried Idyll

_1870, Orchestral_

<div class='embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3'><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds7sikMNoCk'  allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Taking German folk tunes as his source, Wagner wrote this orchestral tone poem to celebrate Christmas Day 1870, the birth of his son Siegfried and, above all, the love for his wife, Cosima.
