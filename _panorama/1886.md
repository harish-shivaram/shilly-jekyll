When I have fears that I may cease to be  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,  
Before high-piled books, in charact'ry,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold like rich garners the full-ripen'd grain;  
When I behold, upon the nightâ€™s starr'd face,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,  
And think that I may never live to trace  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;  
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I shall never look upon thee more,  
Never have relish in the faery power  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of unreflecting love&mdash;then on the shore  
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think  
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.
