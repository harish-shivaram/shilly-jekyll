description: Another collection of short stories, following the adventures of the collection The Last Wish. Geralt forges ahead, battling monsters, demons and prejudices alike...
book: true

Six short stories, again drawing inspiration from the various fairy tales and folk tales. This collection is less a sequence of cases, as was the previous book, but more of a deep dive into what shape and traits Geralt's character has. There are stories inspired by the little mermaid and the snow queen, among others.

This book also introduces the character of Ciri, and the backstory which links her destiny with that of Geralt. Istredd is also elaborated, and he is pitched as a rival of Geralt, in the affections of Yennefer.

The writing is not as fast paced as the first book, but more care is taken in world building and character analyses. We get a deeper look into Yennefer's psychae (not that pleasant and likeable, honestly).

A thoroughly enjoyable book, but like the first. The story deviates from the TV series, specifically the parts related to Ciri and her connection to Geralt. But honestly, I preferred the book version.
