From the valley we trekked back to Ghangria. It was about             10:30 AM when we started from Ghangria down. Prashi chose to             keep up his cowboy shtick, and even got himself a floppy             Stetson-like black hat. All he lacked was a gun and spurs. Sandy             chose to walk it down this time. To quote, &quot;The damn horse took             my ass yesterday. And I have only one ass. I'll walk, thank             you&quot;.

The walk down was much, much tougher than the route up. It             took me considerably longer, and when I finally reached             Govindghat, at nearly 4:30PM, I was hardly in a shape to stand.             But, we had to get back to Joshimath, and the road only stays             open as long as the sun is up. We got the bikes started, and             headed back to Joshimath post haste. No marks for guessing where             we stayed... GMVN
