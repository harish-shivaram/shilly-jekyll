Well, the other day a friend mentioned that I ought to register my blog with technorati. Apparently Technorati indexes the blog and cross-references it or something.


Anyway, the first part of registering is to tell technorati that this blog here is indeed mine. And to do that I need to create a blog entry with a link to my <a rel="me" href="http://technorati.com/claim/pc65n4emfg">Technorati Profile</a>.


Mind you, this blog entry is just that... a technorati claim entry. Don't read too much into it :)


UPDATE (26/Jul/2017): Well, technorati is <a href="http://searchengineland.com/rip-technorati-blog-search-rankings-popular-blog-tools-sunset-195186">no longer a blog index</a>. So much for that.
