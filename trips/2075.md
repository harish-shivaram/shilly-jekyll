- 9th of September
- _Keylong - Tandi - Udaipur - Killar - Gulabgarh_
- 200km


We got an early start in the morning, and rode down to Tandi.             Just at the entrance of Tandi is a turn to the right, towards             the Udaipur, and the Triloknath temple, which was reputed to be             5000 years old. The 45km ride up to Udaipur was a breeze, and we             made very good time. Beyond Udaipur, the road just disappeared             from under our wheels. What was left was a very rough jeep             track.

About 30km beyond Udaipur, we crossed a glacier from which a             two-foot deep stream flowed right across the road. The freezing             water of the stream was more than 15m wide. A bull-dozer was             attempting to clear the stones under the water, but didn't seem             to have made much progress.

>  Prashi makes his way across the freezer. So deep             and rough that even he struggled across. 

About 50km from Udaipur, we passed the town of Killar (not on             any map). This was the largest town in this area, not that that             is saying much. We did another route check here. Our options             were to push on to a town called Gulabgarh (not on any map), or             take a diversion (not on any map) through a mountain pass called             Sach La, and head to Chamba. The first would take about 4-5             hours, while the latter was a full day's journey (9+ hours) in a             4x4, with no civilization enroute.

Although the route to Gulabgarh was actually heading North             again into Jammu, the dual advantages were that there was tarmac             beyond Gulabgarh and sparse civilization along the route. Both             of these were absent from the Chamba route. We decided to head             to Gulabgarh.
